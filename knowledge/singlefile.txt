# Agents

Detailed guide on creating and managing agents within the CrewAI framework.

## Overview of an Agent

In the CrewAI framework, an `Agent` is an autonomous unit that can:

*   Perform specific tasks
*   Make decisions based on its role and goal
*   Use tools to accomplish objectives
*   Communicate and collaborate with other agents
*   Maintain memory of interactions
*   Delegate tasks when allowed

<Tip>
  Think of an agent as a specialized team member with specific skills, expertise, and responsibilities. For example, a `Researcher` agent might excel at gathering and analyzing information, while a `Writer` agent might be better at creating content.

## Creating Agents

There are two ways to create agents in CrewAI: using **YAML configuration (recommended)** or defining them **directly in code**.

### YAML Configuration (Recommended)

Using YAML configuration provides a cleaner, more maintainable way to define agents. We strongly recommend using this approach in your CrewAI projects.

After creating your CrewAI project as outlined in the [Installation](/installation) section, navigate to the `src/latest_ai_development/config/agents.yaml` file and modify the template to match your requirements.

<Note>
  Variables in your YAML files (like `{topic}`) will be replaced with values from your inputs when running the crew:

  ```python Code
  crew.kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'AI Agents'})
  ```
</Note>

Here's an example of how to configure agents using YAML:

```yaml agents.yaml
# src/latest_ai_development/config/agents.yaml
researcher:
  role: >
    {topic} Senior Data Researcher
  goal: >
    Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}
  backstory: >
    You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest
    developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant
    information and present it in a clear and concise manner.

reporting_analyst:
  role: >
    {topic} Reporting Analyst
  goal: >
    Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings
  backstory: >
    You're a meticulous analyst with a keen eye for detail. You're known for
    your ability to turn complex data into clear and concise reports, making
    it easy for others to understand and act on the information you provide.
```

To use this YAML configuration in your code, create a crew class that inherits from `CrewBase`:

```python Code
# src/latest_ai_development/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

@CrewBase
class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
  """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

  @agent
  def researcher(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
      config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
      verbose=True,
      tools=[SerperDevTool()]
    )

  @agent
  def reporting_analyst(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
      config=self.agents_config['reporting_analyst'],
      verbose=True
    )
```

<Note>
  The names you use in your YAML files (`agents.yaml`) should match the method names in your Python code.
</Note>

### Direct Code Definition

You can create agents directly in code by instantiating the `Agent` class. Here's a comprehensive example showing all available parameters:

```python Code
from crewai import Agent
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

# Create an agent with all available parameters
agent = Agent(
    role="Senior Data Scientist",
    goal="Analyze and interpret complex datasets to provide actionable insights",
    backstory="With over 10 years of experience in data science and machine learning, "
              "you excel at finding patterns in complex datasets.",
    llm="gpt-4",  # Default: OPENAI_MODEL_NAME or "gpt-4"
    function_calling_llm=None,  # Optional: Separate LLM for tool calling
    memory=True,  # Default: True
    verbose=False,  # Default: False
    allow_delegation=False,  # Default: False
    max_iter=20,  # Default: 20 iterations
    max_rpm=None,  # Optional: Rate limit for API calls
    max_execution_time=None,  # Optional: Maximum execution time in seconds
    max_retry_limit=2,  # Default: 2 retries on error
    allow_code_execution=False,  # Default: False
    code_execution_mode="safe",  # Default: "safe" (options: "safe", "unsafe")
    respect_context_window=True,  # Default: True
    use_system_prompt=True,  # Default: True
    tools=[SerperDevTool()],  # Optional: List of tools
    knowledge_sources=None,  # Optional: List of knowledge sources
    embedder_config=None,  # Optional: Custom embedder configuration
    system_template=None,  # Optional: Custom system prompt template
    prompt_template=None,  # Optional: Custom prompt template
    response_template=None,  # Optional: Custom response template
    step_callback=None,  # Optional: Callback function for monitoring
)
```

Let's break down some key parameter combinations for common use cases:

#### Basic Research Agent

```python Code
research_agent = Agent(
    role="Research Analyst",
    goal="Find and summarize information about specific topics",
    backstory="You are an experienced researcher with attention to detail",
    tools=[SerperDevTool()],
    verbose=True  # Enable logging for debugging
)
```

#### Code Development Agent

```python Code
dev_agent = Agent(
    role="Senior Python Developer",
    goal="Write and debug Python code",
    backstory="Expert Python developer with 10 years of experience",
    allow_code_execution=True,
    code_execution_mode="safe",  # Uses Docker for safety
    max_execution_time=300,  # 5-minute timeout
    max_retry_limit=3  # More retries for complex code tasks
)
```

#### Long-Running Analysis Agent

```python Code
analysis_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Perform deep analysis of large datasets",
    backstory="Specialized in big data analysis and pattern recognition",
    memory=True,
    respect_context_window=True,
    max_rpm=10,  # Limit API calls
    function_calling_llm="gpt-4o-mini"  # Cheaper model for tool calls
)
```

#### Custom Template Agent

```python Code
custom_agent = Agent(
    role="Customer Service Representative",
    goal="Assist customers with their inquiries",
    backstory="Experienced in customer support with a focus on satisfaction",
    system_template="""<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
                        {{ .System }}<|eot_id|>""",
    prompt_template="""<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
                        {{ .Prompt }}<|eot_id|>""",
    response_template="""<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
                        {{ .Response }}<|eot_id|>""",
)
```

### Parameter Details

#### Critical Parameters

*   `role`, `goal`, and `backstory` are required and shape the agent's behavior
*   `llm` determines the language model used (default: OpenAI's GPT-4)

#### Memory and Context

*   `memory`: Enable to maintain conversation history
*   `respect_context_window`: Prevents token limit issues
*   `knowledge_sources`: Add domain-specific knowledge bases

#### Execution Control

*   `max_iter`: Maximum attempts before giving best answer
*   `max_execution_time`: Timeout in seconds
*   `max_rpm`: Rate limiting for API calls
*   `max_retry_limit`: Retries on error

#### Code Execution

*   `allow_code_execution`: Must be True to run code
*   `code_execution_mode`:
    *   `"safe"`: Uses Docker (recommended for production)
    *   `"unsafe"`: Direct execution (use only in trusted environments)

#### Templates

*   `system_template`: Defines agent's core behavior
*   `prompt_template`: Structures input format
*   `response_template`: Formats agent responses

<Note>
  When using custom templates, you can use variables like `{role}`, `{goal}`, and `{input}` in your templates. These will be automatically populated during execution.
</Note>

## Agent Tools

Agents can be equipped with various tools to enhance their capabilities. CrewAI supports tools from:

*   [CrewAI Toolkit](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai-tools)
*   [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools)

Here's how to add tools to an agent:

```python Code
from crewai import Agent
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool, WikipediaTools

# Create tools
search_tool = SerperDevTool()
wiki_tool = WikipediaTools()

# Add tools to agent
researcher = Agent(
    role="AI Technology Researcher",
    goal="Research the latest AI developments",
    tools=[search_tool, wiki_tool],
    verbose=True
)
```

## Agent Memory and Context

Agents can maintain memory of their interactions and use context from previous tasks. This is particularly useful for complex workflows where information needs to be retained across multiple tasks.

```python Code
from crewai import Agent

analyst = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze and remember complex data patterns",
    memory=True,  # Enable memory
    verbose=True
)
```

<Note>
  When `memory` is enabled, the agent will maintain context across multiple interactions, improving its ability to handle complex, multi-step tasks.
</Note>

## Important Considerations and Best Practices

### Security and Code Execution

*   When using `allow_code_execution`, be cautious with user input and always validate it
*   Use `code_execution_mode: "safe"` (Docker) in production environments
*   Consider setting appropriate `max_execution_time` limits to prevent infinite loops

### Performance Optimization

*   Use `respect_context_window: true` to prevent token limit issues
*   Set appropriate `max_rpm` to avoid rate limiting
*   Enable `cache: true` to improve performance for repetitive tasks
*   Adjust `max_iter` and `max_retry_limit` based on task complexity

### Memory and Context Management

*   Use `memory: true` for tasks requiring historical context
*   Leverage `knowledge_sources` for domain-specific information
*   Configure `embedder_config` when using custom embedding models
*   Use custom templates (`system_template`, `prompt_template`, `response_template`) for fine-grained control over agent behavior

### Agent Collaboration

*   Enable `allow_delegation: true` when agents need to work together
*   Use `step_callback` to monitor and log agent interactions
*   Consider using different LLMs for different purposes:
    *   Main `llm` for complex reasoning
    *   `function_calling_llm` for efficient tool usage

### Model Compatibility

*   Set `use_system_prompt: false` for older models that don't support system messages
*   Ensure your chosen `llm` supports the features you need (like function calling)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1.  **Rate Limiting**: If you're hitting API rate limits:
    *   Implement appropriate `max_rpm`
    *   Use caching for repetitive operations
    *   Consider batching requests

2.  **Context Window Errors**: If you're exceeding context limits:
    *   Enable `respect_context_window`
    *   Use more efficient prompts
    *   Clear agent memory periodically

3.  **Code Execution Issues**: If code execution fails:
    *   Verify Docker is installed for safe mode
    *   Check execution permissions
    *   Review code sandbox settings

4.  **Memory Issues**: If agent responses seem inconsistent:
    *   Verify memory is enabled
    *   Check knowledge source configuration
    *   Review conversation history management

Remember that agents are most effective when configured according to their specific use case. Take time to understand your requirements and adjust these parameters accordingly.

| **Planning LLM** *(optional)*         | `planning_llm`         | The language model used by the AgentPlanner in a planning process.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

<Tip>
  **Crew Max RPM**: The `max_rpm` attribute sets the maximum number of requests per minute the crew can perform to avoid rate limits and will override individual agents' `max_rpm` settings if you set it.
</Tip>

## Creating Crews

There are two ways to create crews in CrewAI: using **YAML configuration (recommended)** or defining them **directly in code**.

### YAML Configuration (Recommended)

Using YAML configuration provides a cleaner, more maintainable way to define crews and is consistent with how agents and tasks are defined in CrewAI projects.

After creating your CrewAI project as outlined in the [Installation](/installation) section, you can define your crew in a class that inherits from `CrewBase` and uses decorators to define agents, tasks, and the crew itself.

#### Example Crew Class with Decorators

```python code
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task, Process
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, task, crew, before_kickoff, after_kickoff


@CrewBase
class YourCrewName:
    """Description of your crew"""

    # Paths to your YAML configuration files
    # To see an example agent and task defined in YAML, checkout the following:
    # - Task: https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/tasks#yaml-configuration-recommended
    # - Agents: https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents#yaml-configuration-recommended
    agents_config = 'config/agents.yaml' 
    tasks_config = 'config/tasks.yaml' 

    @before_kickoff
    def prepare_inputs(self, inputs):
        # Modify inputs before the crew starts
        inputs['additional_data'] = "Some extra information"
        return inputs

    @after_kickoff
    def process_output(self, output):
        # Modify output after the crew finishes
        output.raw += "\nProcessed after kickoff."
        return output

    @agent
    def agent_one(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['agent_one'],
            verbose=True
        )

    @agent
    def agent_two(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['agent_two'],
            verbose=True
        )

    @task
    def task_one(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['task_one']
        )

    @task
    def task_two(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['task_two']
        )

    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents,  # Automatically collected by the @agent decorator
            tasks=self.tasks,    # Automatically collected by the @task decorator. 
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True,
        )
```

<Note>
  Tasks will be executed in the order they are defined.
</Note>

The `CrewBase` class, along with these decorators, automates the collection of agents and tasks, reducing the need for manual management.

#### Decorators overview from `annotations.py`

CrewAI provides several decorators in the `annotations.py` file that are used to mark methods within your crew class for special handling:

*   `@CrewBase`: Marks the class as a crew base class.
*   `@agent`: Denotes a method that returns an `Agent` object.
*   `@task`: Denotes a method that returns a `Task` object.
*   `@crew`: Denotes the method that returns the `Crew` object.
*   `@before_kickoff`: (Optional) Marks a method to be executed before the crew starts.
*   `@after_kickoff`: (Optional) Marks a method to be executed after the crew finishes.

These decorators help in organizing your crew's structure and automatically collecting agents and tasks without manually listing them.

### Direct Code Definition (Alternative)

Alternatively, you can define the crew directly in code without using YAML configuration files.

```python code
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task, Process
from crewai_tools import YourCustomTool

class YourCrewName:
    def agent_one(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            role="Data Analyst",
            goal="Analyze data trends in the market",
            backstory="An experienced data analyst with a background in economics",
            verbose=True,
            tools=[YourCustomTool()]
        )

    def agent_two(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            role="Market Researcher",
            goal="Gather information on market dynamics",
            backstory="A diligent researcher with a keen eye for detail",
            verbose=True
        )

    def task_one(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            description="Collect recent market data and identify trends.",
            expected_output="A report summarizing key trends in the market.",
            agent=self.agent_one()
        )

    def task_two(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            description="Research factors affecting market dynamics.",
            expected_output="An analysis of factors influencing the market.",
            agent=self.agent_two()
        )

    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        return Crew(
            agents=[self.agent_one(), self.agent_two()],
            tasks=[self.task_one(), self.task_two()],
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True
        )
```

In this example:

*   Agents and tasks are defined directly within the class without decorators.
*   We manually create and manage the list of agents and tasks.
*   This approach provides more control but can be less maintainable for larger projects.

## Crew Output

The output of a crew in the CrewAI framework is encapsulated within the `CrewOutput` class.
This class provides a structured way to access results of the crew's execution, including various formats such as raw strings, JSON, and Pydantic models.
The `CrewOutput` includes the results from the final task output, token usage, and individual task outputs.

### Crew Output Attributes

| Attribute        | Parameters     | Type                       | Description                                                                                          |
| :--------------- | :------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Raw**          | `raw`          | `str`                      | The raw output of the crew. This is the default format for the output.                               |
| **Pydantic**     | `pydantic`     | `Optional[BaseModel]`      | A Pydantic model object representing the structured output of the crew.                              |
| **JSON Dict**    | `json_dict`    | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | A dictionary representing the JSON output of the crew.                                               |
| **Tasks Output** | `tasks_output` | `List[TaskOutput]`         | A list of `TaskOutput` objects, each representing the output of a task in the crew.                  |
| **Token Usage**  | `token_usage`  | `Dict[str, Any]`           | A summary of token usage, providing insights into the language model's performance during execution. |

### Crew Output Methods and Properties

| Method/Property | Description                                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **json**        | Returns the JSON string representation of the crew output if the output format is JSON.           |
| **to\_dict**    | Converts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.                                           |
| \***\*str\*\*** | Returns the string representation of the crew output, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw. |

### Accessing Crew Outputs

Once a crew has been executed, its output can be accessed through the `output` attribute of the `Crew` object. The `CrewOutput` class provides various ways to interact with and present this output.

#### Example

```python Code
# Example crew execution
crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent, writer_agent],
    tasks=[research_task, write_article_task],
    verbose=True
)

crew_output = crew.kickoff()

# Accessing the crew output
print(f"Raw Output: {crew_output.raw}")
if crew_output.json_dict:
    print(f"JSON Output: {json.dumps(crew_output.json_dict, indent=2)}")
if crew_output.pydantic:
    print(f"Pydantic Output: {crew_output.pydantic}")
print(f"Tasks Output: {crew_output.tasks_output}")
print(f"Token Usage: {crew_output.token_usage}")
```

## Memory Utilization

Crews can utilize memory (short-term, long-term, and entity memory) to enhance their execution and learning over time. This feature allows crews to store and recall execution memories, aiding in decision-making and task execution strategies.

## Cache Utilization

Caches can be employed to store the results of tools' execution, making the process more efficient by reducing the need to re-execute identical tasks.

## Crew Usage Metrics

After the crew execution, you can access the `usage_metrics` attribute to view the language model (LLM) usage metrics for all tasks executed by the crew. This provides insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement.

```python Code
# Access the crew's usage metrics
crew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2])
crew.kickoff()
print(crew.usage_metrics)
```

## Crew Execution Process

*   **Sequential Process**: Tasks are executed one after another, allowing for a linear flow of work.
*   **Hierarchical Process**: A manager agent coordinates the crew, delegating tasks and validating outcomes before proceeding. **Note**: A `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` is required for this process and it's essential for validating the process flow.

### Kicking Off a Crew

Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the `kickoff()` method. This starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.

```python Code
# Start the crew's task execution
result = my_crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

### Different Ways to Kick Off a Crew

Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the appropriate kickoff method. CrewAI provides several methods for better control over the kickoff process: `kickoff()`, `kickoff_for_each()`, `kickoff_async()`, and `kickoff_for_each_async()`.

*   `kickoff()`: Starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.
*   `kickoff_for_each()`: Executes tasks for each agent individually.
*   `kickoff_async()`: Initiates the workflow asynchronously.
*   `kickoff_for_each_async()`: Executes tasks for each agent individually in an asynchronous manner.

```python Code
# Start the crew's task execution
result = my_crew.kickoff()
print(result)

# Example of using kickoff_for_each
inputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]
results = my_crew.kickoff_for_each(inputs=inputs_array)
for result in results:
    print(result)

# Example of using kickoff_async
inputs = {'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}
async_result = my_crew.kickoff_async(inputs=inputs)
print(async_result)

# Example of using kickoff_for_each_async
inputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]
async_results = my_crew.kickoff_for_each_async(inputs=inputs_array)
for async_result in async_results:
    print(async_result)
```

These methods provide flexibility in how you manage and execute tasks within your crew, allowing for both synchronous and asynchronous workflows tailored to your needs.

### Replaying from a Specific Task

You can now replay from a specific task using our CLI command `replay`.

The replay feature in CrewAI allows you to replay from a specific task using the command-line interface (CLI). By running the command `crewai replay -t <task_id>`, you can specify the `task_id` for the replay process.

Kickoffs will now save the latest kickoffs returned task outputs locally for you to be able to replay from.

### Replaying from a Specific Task Using the CLI

To use the replay feature, follow these steps:

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where your CrewAI project is located.
3.  Run the following command:

To view the latest kickoff task IDs, use:

```shell
crewai log-tasks-outputs
```

Then, to replay from a specific task, use:

```shell
crewai replay -t <task_id>
```

These commands let you replay from your latest kickoff tasks, still retaining context from previously executed tasks.


# Flows

Learn how to create and manage AI workflows using CrewAI Flows.

## Introduction

CrewAI Flows is a powerful feature designed to streamline the creation and management of AI workflows. Flows allow developers to combine and coordinate coding tasks and Crews efficiently, providing a robust framework for building sophisticated AI automations.

Flows allow you to create structured, event-driven workflows. They provide a seamless way to connect multiple tasks, manage state, and control the flow of execution in your AI applications. With Flows, you can easily design and implement multi-step processes that leverage the full potential of CrewAI's capabilities.

1.  **Simplified Workflow Creation**: Easily chain together multiple Crews and tasks to create complex AI workflows.

2.  **State Management**: Flows make it super easy to manage and share state between different tasks in your workflow.

3.  **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built on an event-driven model, allowing for dynamic and responsive workflows.

4.  **Flexible Control Flow**: Implement conditional logic, loops, and branching within your workflows.

## Getting Started

Let's create a simple Flow where you will use OpenAI to generate a random city in one task and then use that city to generate a fun fact in another task.

```python Code

from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from litellm import completion


class ExampleFlow(Flow):
    model = "gpt-4o-mini"

    @start()
    def generate_city(self):
        print("Starting flow")

        response = completion(
            model=self.model,
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "Return the name of a random city in the world.",
                },
            ],
        )

        random_city = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
        print(f"Random City: {random_city}")

        return random_city

    @listen(generate_city)
    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):
        response = completion(
            model=self.model,
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": f"Tell me a fun fact about {random_city}",
                },
            ],
        )

        fun_fact = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
        return fun_fact



flow = ExampleFlow()
result = flow.kickoff()

print(f"Generated fun fact: {result}")
```

In the above example, we have created a simple Flow that generates a random city using OpenAI and then generates a fun fact about that city. The Flow consists of two tasks: `generate_city` and `generate_fun_fact`. The `generate_city` task is the starting point of the Flow, and the `generate_fun_fact` task listens for the output of the `generate_city` task.

When you run the Flow, it will generate a random city and then generate a fun fact about that city. The output will be printed to the console.

**Note:** Ensure you have set up your `.env` file to store your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. This key is necessary for authenticating requests to the OpenAI API.

### @start()

The `@start()` decorator is used to mark a method as the starting point of a Flow. When a Flow is started, all the methods decorated with `@start()` are executed in parallel. You can have multiple start methods in a Flow, and they will all be executed when the Flow is started.

### @listen()

The `@listen()` decorator is used to mark a method as a listener for the output of another task in the Flow. The method decorated with `@listen()` will be executed when the specified task emits an output. The method can access the output of the task it is listening to as an argument.

#### Usage

The `@listen()` decorator can be used in several ways:

1.  **Listening to a Method by Name**: You can pass the name of the method you want to listen to as a string. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.

    ```python Code
    @listen("generate_city")
    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):
        # Implementation
    ```

2.  **Listening to a Method Directly**: You can pass the method itself. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.
    ```python Code
    @listen(generate_city)
    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):
        # Implementation
    ```

### Flow Output

Accessing and handling the output of a Flow is essential for integrating your AI workflows into larger applications or systems. CrewAI Flows provide straightforward mechanisms to retrieve the final output, access intermediate results, and manage the overall state of your Flow.

#### Retrieving the Final Output

When you run a Flow, the final output is determined by the last method that completes. The `kickoff()` method returns the output of this final method.

Here's how you can access the final output:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Code
  from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

  class OutputExampleFlow(Flow):
      @start()
      def first_method(self):
          return "Output from first_method"

      @listen(first_method)
      def second_method(self, first_output):
          return f"Second method received: {first_output}"


  flow = OutputExampleFlow()
  final_output = flow.kickoff()

  print("---- Final Output ----")
  print(final_output)
  ```

  ```text Output
  ---- Final Output ----
  Second method received: Output from first_method
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In this example, the `second_method` is the last method to complete, so its output will be the final output of the Flow.
The `kickoff()` method will return the final output, which is then printed to the console.

#### Accessing and Updating State

In addition to retrieving the final output, you can also access and update the state within your Flow. The state can be used to store and share data between different methods in the Flow. After the Flow has run, you can access the state to retrieve any information that was added or updated during the execution.

Here's an example of how to update and access the state:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Code
  from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
  from pydantic import BaseModel

  class ExampleState(BaseModel):
      counter: int = 0
      message: str = ""

  class StateExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):

      @start()
      def first_method(self):
          self.state.message = "Hello from first_method"
          self.state.counter += 1

      @listen(first_method)
      def second_method(self):
          self.state.message += " - updated by second_method"
          self.state.counter += 1
          return self.state.message

  flow = StateExampleFlow()
  final_output = flow.kickoff()
  print(f"Final Output: {final_output}")
  print("Final State:")
  print(flow.state)
  ```

  ```text Output
  Final Output: Hello from first_method - updated by second_method
  Final State:
  counter=2 message='Hello from first_method - updated by second_method'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In this example, the state is updated by both `first_method` and `second_method`.
After the Flow has run, you can access the final state to see the updates made by these methods.

By ensuring that the final method's output is returned and providing access to the state, CrewAI Flows make it easy to integrate the results of your AI workflows into larger applications or systems,
while also maintaining and accessing the state throughout the Flow's execution.

## Flow State Management

Managing state effectively is crucial for building reliable and maintainable AI workflows. CrewAI Flows provides robust mechanisms for both unstructured and structured state management,
allowing developers to choose the approach that best fits their application's needs.

### Unstructured State Management

In unstructured state management, all state is stored in the `state` attribute of the `Flow` class.
This approach offers flexibility, enabling developers to add or modify state attributes on the fly without defining a strict schema.

```python Code
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

class UntructuredExampleFlow(Flow):

    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        self.state.message = "Hello from structured flow"
        self.state.counter = 0

    @listen(first_method)
    def second_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated"

    @listen(second_method)
    def third_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated again"

        print(f"State after third_method: {self.state}")


flow = UntructuredExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```

**Key Points:**

*   **Flexibility:** You can dynamically add attributes to `self.state` without predefined constraints.
*   **Simplicity:** Ideal for straightforward workflows where state structure is minimal or varies significantly.

### Structured State Management

Structured state management leverages predefined schemas to ensure consistency and type safety across the workflow.
By using models like Pydantic's `BaseModel`, developers can define the exact shape of the state, enabling better validation and auto-completion in development environments.

```python Code
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from pydantic import BaseModel


class ExampleState(BaseModel):
    counter: int = 0
    message: str = ""


class StructuredExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):

    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        self.state.message = "Hello from structured flow"

    @listen(first_method)
    def second_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated"

    @listen(second_method)
    def third_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated again"

        print(f"State after third_method: {self.state}")


flow = StructuredExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```

**Key Points:**

*   **Defined Schema:** `ExampleState` clearly outlines the state structure, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
*   **Type Safety:** Leveraging Pydantic ensures that state attributes adhere to the specified types, reducing runtime errors.
*   **Auto-Completion:** IDEs can provide better auto-completion and error checking based on the defined state model.

### Choosing Between Unstructured and Structured State Management

*   **Use Unstructured State Management when:**

    *   The workflow's state is simple or highly dynamic.
    *   Flexibility is prioritized over strict state definitions.
    *   Rapid prototyping is required without the overhead of defining schemas.

*   **Use Structured State Management when:**
    *   The workflow requires a well-defined and consistent state structure.
    *   Type safety and validation are important for your application's reliability.
    *   You want to leverage IDE features like auto-completion and type checking for better developer experience.

By providing both unstructured and structured state management options, CrewAI Flows empowers developers to build AI workflows that are both flexible and robust, catering to a wide range of application requirements.

## Flow Control

### Conditional Logic: `or`

The `or_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Code
  from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, or_, start

  class OrExampleFlow(Flow):

      @start()
      def start_method(self):
          return "Hello from the start method"

      @listen(start_method)
      def second_method(self):
          return "Hello from the second method"

      @listen(or_(start_method, second_method))
      def logger(self, result):
          print(f"Logger: {result}")



  flow = OrExampleFlow()
  flow.kickoff()
  ```

  ```text Output
  Logger: Hello from the start method
  Logger: Hello from the second method
  ```
</CodeGroup>

When you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered by the output of either the `start_method` or the `second_method`.
The `or_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.

### Conditional Logic: `and`

The `and_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Code
  from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, and_, listen, start

  class AndExampleFlow(Flow):

      @start()
      def start_method(self):
          self.state["greeting"] = "Hello from the start method"

      @listen(start_method)
      def second_method(self):
          self.state["joke"] = "What do computers eat? Microchips."

      @listen(and_(start_method, second_method))
      def logger(self):
          print("---- Logger ----")
          print(self.state)

  flow = AndExampleFlow()
  flow.kickoff()
  ```

  ```text Output
  ---- Logger ----
  {'greeting': 'Hello from the start method', 'joke': 'What do computers eat? Microchips.'}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

When you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered only when both the `start_method` and the `second_method` emit an output.
The `and_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.

### Router

The `@router()` decorator in Flows allows you to define conditional routing logic based on the output of a method.
You can specify different routes based on the output of the method, allowing you to control the flow of execution dynamically.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Code
  import random
  from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, router, start
  from pydantic import BaseModel

  class ExampleState(BaseModel):
      success_flag: bool = False

  class RouterFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):

      @start()
      def start_method(self):
          print("Starting the structured flow")
          random_boolean = random.choice([True, False])
          self.state.success_flag = random_boolean

      @router(start_method)
      def second_method(self):
          if self.state.success_flag:
              return "success"
          else:
              return "failed"

      @listen("success")
      def third_method(self):
          print("Third method running")

      @listen("failed")
      def fourth_method(self):
          print("Fourth method running")


  flow = RouterFlow()
  flow.kickoff()
  ```

  ```text Output
  Starting the structured flow
  Third method running
  Fourth method running
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In the above example, the `start_method` generates a random boolean value and sets it in the state.
The `second_method` uses the `@router()` decorator to define conditional routing logic based on the value of the boolean.
If the boolean is `True`, the method returns `"success"`, and if it is `False`, the method returns `"failed"`.
The `third_method` and `fourth_method` listen to the output of the `second_method` and execute based on the returned value.

When you run this Flow, the output will change based on the random boolean value generated by the `start_method`.

## Adding Crews to Flows

Creating a flow with multiple crews in CrewAI is straightforward.

You can generate a new CrewAI project that includes all the scaffolding needed to create a flow with multiple crews by running the following command:

```bash
crewai create flow name_of_flow
```

This command will generate a new CrewAI project with the necessary folder structure. The generated project includes a prebuilt crew called `poem_crew` that is already working. You can use this crew as a template by copying, pasting, and editing it to create other crews.

### Folder Structure

After running the `crewai create flow name_of_flow` command, you will see a folder structure similar to the following:

| Directory/File         | Description                                                         |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name_of_flow/`        | Root directory for the flow.                                        |
| ├── `crews/`           | Contains directories for specific crews.                            |
| │ └── `poem_crew/`     | Directory for the "poem\_crew" with its configurations and scripts. |
| │ ├── `config/`        | Configuration files directory for the "poem\_crew".                 |
| │ │ ├── `agents.yaml`  | YAML file defining the agents for "poem\_crew".                     |
| │ │ └── `tasks.yaml`   | YAML file defining the tasks for "poem\_crew".                      |
| │ ├── `poem_crew.py`   | Script for "poem\_crew" functionality.                              |
| ├── `tools/`           | Directory for additional tools used in the flow.                    |
| │ └── `custom_tool.py` | Custom tool implementation.                                         |
| ├── `main.py`          | Main script for running the flow.                                   |
| ├── `README.md`        | Project description and instructions.                               |
| ├── `pyproject.toml`   | Configuration file for project dependencies and settings.           |
| └── `.gitignore`       | Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control.       |

### Building Your Crews

In the `crews` folder, you can define multiple crews. Each crew will have its own folder containing configuration files and the crew definition file. For example, the `poem_crew` folder contains:

*   `config/agents.yaml`: Defines the agents for the crew.
*   `config/tasks.yaml`: Defines the tasks for the crew.
*   `poem_crew.py`: Contains the crew definition, including agents, tasks, and the crew itself.

You can copy, paste, and edit the `poem_crew` to create other crews.

### Connecting Crews in `main.py`

The `main.py` file is where you create your flow and connect the crews together. You can define your flow by using the `Flow` class and the decorators `@start` and `@listen` to specify the flow of execution.

Here's an example of how you can connect the `poem_crew` in the `main.py` file:

```python Code
#!/usr/bin/env python
from random import randint

from pydantic import BaseModel
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from .crews.poem_crew.poem_crew import PoemCrew

class PoemState(BaseModel):
    sentence_count: int = 1
    poem: str = ""

class PoemFlow(Flow[PoemState]):

    @start()
    def generate_sentence_count(self):
        print("Generating sentence count")
        self.state.sentence_count = randint(1, 5)

    @listen(generate_sentence_count)
    def generate_poem(self):
        print("Generating poem")
        result = PoemCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs={"sentence_count": self.state.sentence_count})

        print("Poem generated", result.raw)
        self.state.poem = result.raw

    @listen(generate_poem)
    def save_poem(self):
        print("Saving poem")
        with open("poem.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write(self.state.poem)

def kickoff():
    poem_flow = PoemFlow()
    poem_flow.kickoff()


def plot():
    poem_flow = PoemFlow()
    poem_flow.plot()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    kickoff()
```

In this example, the `PoemFlow` class defines a flow that generates a sentence count, uses the `PoemCrew` to generate a poem, and then saves the poem to a file. The flow is kicked off by calling the `kickoff()` method.

### Running the Flow

(Optional) Before running the flow, you can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
crewai install
```

Once all of the dependencies are installed, you need to activate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

After activating the virtual environment, you can run the flow by executing one of the following commands:

```bash
crewai flow kickoff
```

or

```bash
uv run kickoff
```

The flow will execute, and you should see the output in the console.

## Plot Flows

Visualizing your AI workflows can provide valuable insights into the structure and execution paths of your flows. CrewAI offers a powerful visualization tool that allows you to generate interactive plots of your flows, making it easier to understand and optimize your AI workflows.

### What are Plots?

Plots in CrewAI are graphical representations of your AI workflows. They display the various tasks, their connections, and the flow of data between them. This visualization helps in understanding the sequence of operations, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring that the workflow logic aligns with your expectations.

### How to Generate a Plot

CrewAI provides two convenient methods to generate plots of your flows:

#### Option 1: Using the `plot()` Method

If you are working directly with a flow instance, you can generate a plot by calling the `plot()` method on your flow object. This method will create an HTML file containing the interactive plot of your flow.

```python Code
# Assuming you have a flow instance
flow.plot("my_flow_plot")
```

This will generate a file named `my_flow_plot.html` in your current directory. You can open this file in a web browser to view the interactive plot.

#### Option 2: Using the Command Line

If you are working within a structured CrewAI project, you can generate a plot using the command line. This is particularly useful for larger projects where you want to visualize the entire flow setup.

```bash
crewai flow plot
```

This command will generate an HTML file with the plot of your flow, similar to the `plot()` method. The file will be saved in your project directory, and you can open it in a web browser to explore the flow.

### Understanding the Plot

The generated plot will display nodes representing the tasks in your flow, with directed edges indicating the flow of execution. The plot is interactive, allowing you to zoom in and out, and hover over nodes to see additional details.

By visualizing your flows, you can gain a clearer understanding of the workflow's structure, making it easier to debug, optimize, and communicate your AI processes to others.

### Conclusion

Plotting your flows is a powerful feature of CrewAI that enhances your ability to design and manage complex AI workflows. Whether you choose to use the `plot()` method or the command line, generating plots will provide you with a visual representation of your workflows, aiding in both development and presentation.

## Next Steps

If you're interested in exploring additional examples of flows, we have a variety of recommendations in our examples repository. Here are four specific flow examples, each showcasing unique use cases to help you match your current problem type to a specific example:

1.  **Email Auto Responder Flow**: This example demonstrates an infinite loop where a background job continually runs to automate email responses. It's a great use case for tasks that need to be performed repeatedly without manual intervention. [View Example](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/email_auto_responder_flow)

2.  **Lead Score Flow**: This flow showcases adding human-in-the-loop feedback and handling different conditional branches using the router. It's an excellent example of how to incorporate dynamic decision-making and human oversight into your workflows. [View Example](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/lead-score-flow)

3.  **Write a Book Flow**: This example excels at chaining multiple crews together, where the output of one crew is used by another. Specifically, one crew outlines an entire book, and another crew generates chapters based on the outline. Eventually, everything is connected to produce a complete book. This flow is perfect for complex, multi-step processes that require coordination between different tasks. [View Example](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/write_a_book_with_flows)

4.  **Meeting Assistant Flow**: This flow demonstrates how to broadcast one event to trigger multiple follow-up actions. For instance, after a meeting is completed, the flow can update a Trello board, send a Slack message, and save the results. It's a great example of handling multiple outcomes from a single event, making it ideal for comprehensive task management and notification systems. [View Example](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/meeting_assistant_flow)

By exploring these examples, you can gain insights into how to leverage CrewAI Flows for various use cases, from automating repetitive tasks to managing complex, multi-step processes with dynamic decision-making and human feedback.

# Knowledge

What is knowledge in CrewAI and how to use it.

## What is Knowledge?

Knowledge in CrewAI is a powerful system that allows AI agents to access and utilize external information sources during their tasks.
Think of it as giving your agents a reference library they can consult while working.

<Info>
  Key benefits of using Knowledge:

  *   Enhance agents with domain-specific information
  *   Support decisions with real-world data
  *   Maintain context across conversations
  *   Ground responses in factual information
</Info>

## Supported Knowledge Sources

CrewAI supports various types of knowledge sources out of the box:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Text Sources" icon="text">
    *   Raw strings
    *   Text files (.txt)
    *   PDF documents
  </Card>

  <Card title="Structured Data" icon="table">
    *   CSV files
    *   Excel spreadsheets
    *   JSON documents
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Supported Knowledge Parameters

| Parameter         | Type                            | Required | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sources`         | **List\[BaseKnowledgeSource]**  | Yes      | List of knowledge sources that provide content to be stored and queried. Can include PDF, CSV, Excel, JSON, text files, or string content.        |
| `collection_name` | **str**                         | No       | Name of the collection where the knowledge will be stored. Used to identify different sets of knowledge. Defaults to "knowledge" if not provided. |
| `storage`         | **Optional\[KnowledgeStorage]** | No       | Custom storage configuration for managing how the knowledge is stored and retrieved. If not provided, a default storage will be created.          |

## Quickstart Example

<Tip>
  For file-Based Knowledge Sources, make sure to place your files in a `knowledge` directory at the root of your project.
  Also, use relative paths from the `knowledge` directory when creating the source.
</Tip>

Here's an example using string-based knowledge:

```python Code
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process, LLM
from crewai.knowledge.source.string_knowledge_source import StringKnowledgeSource

# Create a knowledge source
content = "Users name is John. He is 30 years old and lives in San Francisco."
string_source = StringKnowledgeSource(
    content=content,
)

# Create an LLM with a temperature of 0 to ensure deterministic outputs
llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)

# Create an agent with the knowledge store
agent = Agent(
    role="About User",
    goal="You know everything about the user.",
    backstory="""You are a master at understanding people and their preferences.""",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm=llm,
)
task = Task(
    description="Answer the following questions about the user: {question}",
    expected_output="An answer to the question.",
    agent=agent,
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True,
    process=Process.sequential,
    knowledge_sources=[string_source], # Enable knowledge by adding the sources here. You can also add more sources to the sources list.
)

result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"question": "What city does John live in and how old is he?"})
```

Here's another example with the `CrewDoclingSource`. The CrewDoclingSource is actually quite versatile and can handle multiple file formats including TXT, PDF, DOCX, HTML, and more.

```python Code
from crewai import LLM, Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.knowledge.source.crew_docling_source import CrewDoclingSource

# Create a knowledge source
content_source = CrewDoclingSource(
    file_paths=[
        "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-11-28-reward-hacking",
        "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination",
    ],
)

# Create an LLM with a temperature of 0 to ensure deterministic outputs
llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)

# Create an agent with the knowledge store
agent = Agent(
    role="About papers",
    goal="You know everything about the papers.",
    backstory="""You are a master at understanding papers and their content.""",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm=llm,
)
task = Task(
    description="Answer the following questions about the papers: {question}",
    expected_output="An answer to the question.",
    agent=agent,
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True,
    process=Process.sequential,
    knowledge_sources=[
        content_source
    ],  # Enable knowledge by adding the sources here. You can also add more sources to the sources list.
)

result = crew.kickoff(
    inputs={
        "question": "What is the reward hacking paper about? Be sure to provide sources."
    }
)
```

## More Examples

Here are examples of how to use different types of knowledge sources:

### Text File Knowledge Source

```python
from crewai.knowledge.source import CrewDoclingSource

# Create a text file knowledge source
text_source = CrewDoclingSource(
    file_paths=["document.txt", "another.txt"]
)

# Create knowledge with text file source
knowledge = Knowledge(
    collection_name="text_knowledge",
    sources=[text_source]
)
```

### PDF Knowledge Source

```python
from crewai.knowledge.source import PDFKnowledgeSource

# Create a PDF knowledge source
pdf_source = PDFKnowledgeSource(
    file_paths=["document.pdf", "another.pdf"]
)

# Create knowledge with PDF source
knowledge = Knowledge(
    collection_name="pdf_knowledge",
    sources=[pdf_source]
)
```

### CSV Knowledge Source

```python
from crewai.knowledge.source import CSVKnowledgeSource

# Create a CSV knowledge source
csv_source = CSVKnowledgeSource(
    file_paths=["data.csv"]
)

# Create knowledge with CSV source
knowledge = Knowledge(
    collection_name="csv_knowledge",
    sources=[csv_source]
)
```

### Excel Knowledge Source

```python
from crewai.knowledge.source import ExcelKnowledgeSource

# Create an Excel knowledge source
excel_source = ExcelKnowledgeSource(
    file_paths=["spreadsheet.xlsx"]
)

# Create knowledge with Excel source
knowledge = Knowledge(
    collection_name="excel_knowledge",
    sources=[excel_source]
)
```

### JSON Knowledge Source

```python
from crewai.knowledge.source import JSONKnowledgeSource

# Create a JSON knowledge source
json_source = JSONKnowledgeSource(
    file_paths=["data.json"]
)

# Create knowledge with JSON source
knowledge = Knowledge(
    collection_name="json_knowledge",
    sources=[json_source]
)
```

## Knowledge Configuration

### Chunking Configuration

Knowledge sources automatically chunk content for better processing.
You can configure chunking behavior in your knowledge sources:

```python
from crewai.knowledge.source import StringKnowledgeSource

source = StringKnowledgeSource(
    content="Your content here",
    chunk_size=4000,      # Maximum size of each chunk (default: 4000)
    chunk_overlap=200     # Overlap between chunks (default: 200)
)
```

The chunking configuration helps in:

*   Breaking down large documents into manageable pieces
*   Maintaining context through chunk overlap
*   Optimizing retrieval accuracy

### Embeddings Configuration

You can also configure the embedder for the knowledge store.
This is useful if you want to use a different embedder for the knowledge store than the one used for the agents.
The `embedder` parameter supports various embedding model providers that include:

*   `openai`: OpenAI's embedding models
*   `google`: Google's text embedding models
*   `azure`: Azure OpenAI embeddings
*   `ollama`: Local embeddings with Ollama
*   `vertexai`: Google Cloud VertexAI embeddings
*   `cohere`: Cohere's embedding models
*   `bedrock`: AWS Bedrock embeddings
*   `huggingface`: Hugging Face models
*   `watson`: IBM Watson embeddings

Here's an example of how to configure the embedder for the knowledge store using Google's `text-embedding-004` model:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Example
  from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process, LLM
  from crewai.knowledge.source.string_knowledge_source import StringKnowledgeSource
  import os

  # Get the GEMINI API key
  GEMINI_API_KEY = os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY")

  # Create a knowledge source
  content = "Users name is John. He is 30 years old and lives in San Francisco."
  string_source = StringKnowledgeSource(
      content=content,
  )

  # Create an LLM with a temperature of 0 to ensure deterministic outputs
  gemini_llm = LLM(
      model="gemini/gemini-1.5-pro-002",
      api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY,
      temperature=0,
  )

  # Create an agent with the knowledge store
  agent = Agent(
      role="About User",
      goal="You know everything about the user.",
      backstory="""You are a master at understanding people and their preferences.""",
      verbose=True,
      allow_delegation=False,
      llm=gemini_llm,
  )

  task = Task(
      description="Answer the following questions about the user: {question}",
      expected_output="An answer to the question.",
      agent=agent,
  )

  crew = Crew(
      agents=[agent],
      tasks=[task],
      verbose=True,
      process=Process.sequential,
      knowledge_sources=[string_source],
      embedder={
          "provider": "google",
          "config": {
              "model": "models/text-embedding-004",
              "api_key": GEMINI_API_KEY,
          }
      }
  )

  result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"question": "What city does John live in and how old is he?"})
  ```

  ```text Output
  # Agent: About User
  ## Task: Answer the following questions about the user: What city does John live in and how old is he?

  # Agent: About User
  ## Final Answer: 
  John is 30 years old and lives in San Francisco.
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Clearing Knowledge

If you need to clear the knowledge stored in CrewAI, you can use the `crewai reset-memories` command with the `--knowledge` option.

```bash Command
crewai reset-memories --knowledge
```

This is useful when you've updated your knowledge sources and want to ensure that the agents are using the most recent information.

## Agent-Specific Knowledge

While knowledge can be provided at the crew level using `crew.knowledge_sources`, individual agents can also have their own knowledge sources using the `knowledge_sources` parameter:

```python Code
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai.knowledge.source.string_knowledge_source import StringKnowledgeSource

# Create agent-specific knowledge about a product
product_specs = StringKnowledgeSource(
    content="""The XPS 13 laptop features:
    - 13.4-inch 4K display
    - Intel Core i7 processor
    - 16GB RAM
    - 512GB SSD storage
    - 12-hour battery life""",
    metadata={"category": "product_specs"}
)

# Create a support agent with product knowledge
support_agent = Agent(
    role="Technical Support Specialist",
    goal="Provide accurate product information and support.",
    backstory="You are an expert on our laptop products and specifications.",
    knowledge_sources=[product_specs]  # Agent-specific knowledge
)

# Create a task that requires product knowledge
support_task = Task(
    description="Answer this customer question: {question}",
    agent=support_agent
)

# Create and run the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[support_agent],
    tasks=[support_task]
)

# Get answer about the laptop's specifications
result = crew.kickoff(
    inputs={"question": "What is the storage capacity of the XPS 13?"}
)
```

<Info>
  Benefits of agent-specific knowledge:

  *   Give agents specialized information for their roles
  *   Maintain separation of concerns between agents
  *   Combine with crew-level knowledge for layered information access
</Info>

## Custom Knowledge Sources

CrewAI allows you to create custom knowledge sources for any type of data by extending the `BaseKnowledgeSource` class. Let's create a practical example that fetches and processes space news articles.

#### Space News Knowledge Source Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Code
  from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process, LLM
  from crewai.knowledge.source.base_knowledge_source import BaseKnowledgeSource
  import requests
  from datetime import datetime
  from typing import Dict, Any
  from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

  class SpaceNewsKnowledgeSource(BaseKnowledgeSource):
      """Knowledge source that fetches data from Space News API."""

      api_endpoint: str = Field(description="API endpoint URL")
      limit: int = Field(default=10, description="Number of articles to fetch")

      def load_content(self) -> Dict[Any, str]:
          """Fetch and format space news articles."""
          try:
              response = requests.get(
                  f"{self.api_endpoint}?limit={self.limit}"
              )
              response.raise_for_status()

# LLMs

A comprehensive guide to configuring and using Large Language Models (LLMs) in your CrewAI projects

<Note>
  CrewAI integrates with multiple LLM providers through LiteLLM, giving you the flexibility to choose the right model for your specific use case. This guide will help you understand how to configure and use different LLM providers in your CrewAI projects.
</Note>

## What are LLMs?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are the core intelligence behind CrewAI agents. They enable agents to understand context, make decisions, and generate human-like responses. Here's what you need to know:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="LLM Basics" icon="brain">
    Large Language Models are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data. They power the intelligence of your CrewAI agents, enabling them to understand and generate human-like text.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Context Window" icon="window">
    The context window determines how much text an LLM can process at once. Larger windows (e.g., 128K tokens) allow for more context but may be more expensive and slower.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Temperature" icon="temperature-three-quarters">
    Temperature (0.0 to 1.0) controls response randomness. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) produce more focused, deterministic outputs, while higher values (e.g., 0.8) increase creativity and variability.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Provider Selection" icon="server">
    Each LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) offers different models with varying capabilities, pricing, and features. Choose based on your needs for accuracy, speed, and cost.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Available Models and Their Capabilities

## Setting Up Your LLM

There are three ways to configure LLMs in CrewAI. Choose the method that best fits your workflow:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Environment Variables">
    The simplest way to get started. Set these variables in your environment:

    ```bash
    # Required: Your API key for authentication
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>

    # Optional: Default model selection
    OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini  # Default if not set

    # Optional: Organization ID (if applicable)
    OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID=<your-org-id>
    ```

    <Warning>
      Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment files (.env) or your system's secret management.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="2. YAML Configuration">
    Create a YAML file to define your agent configurations. This method is great for version control and team collaboration:

  <Accordion title="Context Window Management">
    CrewAI includes smart context management features:

    ```python
    from crewai import LLM

    # CrewAI automatically handles:
    # 1. Token counting and tracking
    # 2. Content summarization when needed
    # 3. Task splitting for large contexts

    llm = LLM(
        model="gpt-4",
        max_tokens=4000,  # Limit response length
    )
    ```

    <Info>
      Best practices for context management:

      1.  Choose models with appropriate context windows
      2.  Pre-process long inputs when possible
      3.  Use chunking for large documents
      4.  Monitor token usage to optimize costs

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Token Usage Optimization">
        Choose the right context window for your task:

        *   Small tasks (up to 4K tokens): Standard models
        *   Medium tasks (between 4K-32K): Enhanced models
        *   Large tasks (over 32K): Large context models

        ```python
        # Configure model with appropriate settings
        llm = LLM(
            model="openai/gpt-4-turbo-preview",
            temperature=0.7,    # Adjust based on task
            max_tokens=4096,    # Set based on output needs
            timeout=300        # Longer timeout for complex tasks
        )
        ```

        <Tip>
          *   Lower temperature (0.1 to 0.3) for factual responses
          *   Higher temperature (0.7 to 0.9) for creative tasks
        </Tip>
      </Step>

# Memory

Leveraging memory systems in the CrewAI framework to enhance agent capabilities.

## Introduction to Memory Systems in CrewAI

The crewAI framework introduces a sophisticated memory system designed to significantly enhance the capabilities of AI agents.
This system comprises `short-term memory`, `long-term memory`, `entity memory`, and `contextual memory`, each serving a unique purpose in aiding agents to remember,
reason, and learn from past interactions.

## Memory System Components

| Component             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Short-Term Memory** | Temporarily stores recent interactions and outcomes using `RAG`, enabling agents to recall and utilize information relevant to their current context during the current executions.                              |
| **Long-Term Memory**  | Preserves valuable insights and learnings from past executions, allowing agents to build and refine their knowledge over time.                                                                                   |
| **Entity Memory**     | Captures and organizes information about entities (people, places, concepts) encountered during tasks, facilitating deeper understanding and relationship mapping. Uses `RAG` for storing entity information.    |
| **Contextual Memory** | Maintains the context of interactions by combining `ShortTermMemory`, `LongTermMemory`, and `EntityMemory`, aiding in the coherence and relevance of agent responses over a sequence of tasks or a conversation. |
| **User Memory**       | Stores user-specific information and preferences, enhancing personalization and user experience.                                                                                                                 |

## How Memory Systems Empower Agents

1.  **Contextual Awareness**: With short-term and contextual memory, agents gain the ability to maintain context over a conversation or task sequence, leading to more coherent and relevant responses.

2.  **Experience Accumulation**: Long-term memory allows agents to accumulate experiences, learning from past actions to improve future decision-making and problem-solving.

3.  **Entity Understanding**: By maintaining entity memory, agents can recognize and remember key entities, enhancing their ability to process and interact with complex information.

## Implementing Memory in Your Crew

When configuring a crew, you can enable and customize each memory component to suit the crew's objectives and the nature of tasks it will perform.
By default, the memory system is disabled, and you can ensure it is active by setting `memory=True` in the crew configuration.
The memory will use OpenAI embeddings by default, but you can change it by setting `embedder` to a different model.
It's also possible to initialize the memory instance with your own instance.

The 'embedder' only applies to **Short-Term Memory** which uses Chroma for RAG.
The **Long-Term Memory** uses SQLite3 to store task results. Currently, there is no way to override these storage implementations.
The data storage files are saved into a platform-specific location found using the appdirs package,
and the name of the project can be overridden using the **CREWAI\_STORAGE\_DIR** environment variable.

### Example: Configuring Memory for a Crew

```python Code
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Assemble your crew with memory capabilities
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    process=Process.sequential,
    memory=True,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Example: Use Custom Memory Instances e.g FAISS as the VectorDB

```python Code
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Assemble your crew with memory capabilities
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    process="Process.sequential",
    memory=True,
    long_term_memory=EnhanceLongTermMemory(
        storage=LTMSQLiteStorage(
            db_path="/my_data_dir/my_crew1/long_term_memory_storage.db"
        )
    ),
    short_term_memory=EnhanceShortTermMemory(
        storage=CustomRAGStorage(
            crew_name="my_crew",
            storage_type="short_term",
            data_dir="//my_data_dir",
            model=embedder["model"],
            dimension=embedder["dimension"],
        ),
    ),
    entity_memory=EnhanceEntityMemory(
        storage=CustomRAGStorage(
            crew_name="my_crew",
            storage_type="entities",
            data_dir="//my_data_dir",
            model=embedder["model"],
            dimension=embedder["dimension"],
        ),
    ),
    verbose=True,
)
```

## Integrating Mem0 for Enhanced User Memory

[Mem0](https://mem0.ai/) is a self-improving memory layer for LLM applications, enabling personalized AI experiences.

To include user-specific memory you can get your API key [here](https://app.mem0.ai/dashboard/api-keys) and refer the [docs](https://docs.mem0.ai/platform/quickstart#4-1-create-memories) for adding user preferences.

```python Code
import os
from crewai import Crew, Process
from mem0 import MemoryClient

# Set environment variables for Mem0
os.environ["MEM0_API_KEY"] = "m0-xx"

# Step 1: Record preferences based on past conversation or user input
client = MemoryClient()
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi there! I'm planning a vacation and could use some advice."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! I'd be happy to help with your vacation planning. What kind of destination do you prefer?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I am more of a beach person than a mountain person."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's interesting. Do you like hotels or Airbnb?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I like Airbnb more."},
]
client.add(messages, user_id="john")

# Step 2: Create a Crew with User Memory

crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    verbose=True,
    process=Process.sequential,
    memory=True,
    memory_config={
        "provider": "mem0",
        "config": {"user_id": "john"},
    },
)
```

## Additional Embedding Providers

### Using OpenAI embeddings (already default)

```python Code
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

my_crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    process=Process.sequential,
    memory=True,
    verbose=True,
    embedder={
        "provider": "openai",
        "config": {
            "model": 'text-embedding-3-small'
        }
    }
)
```

# Planning

Learn how to add planning to your CrewAI Crew and improve their performance.

## Introduction

The planning feature in CrewAI allows you to add planning capability to your crew. When enabled, before each Crew iteration,
all Crew information is sent to an AgentPlanner that will plan the tasks step by step, and this plan will be added to each task description.

### Using the Planning Feature

Getting started with the planning feature is very easy, the only step required is to add `planning=True` to your Crew:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Code
  from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

  # Assemble your crew with planning capabilities
  my_crew = Crew(
      agents=self.agents,
      tasks=self.tasks,
      process=Process.sequential,
      planning=True,
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

From this point on, your crew will have planning enabled, and the tasks will be planned before each iteration.

#### Planning LLM

Now you can define the LLM that will be used to plan the tasks. You can use any ChatOpenAI LLM model available.

When running the base case example, you will see something like the output below, which represents the output of the `AgentPlanner`
responsible for creating the step-by-step logic to add to the Agents' tasks.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Code
  from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
  from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

  # Assemble your crew with planning capabilities and custom LLM
  my_crew = Crew(
      agents=self.agents,
      tasks=self.tasks,
      process=Process.sequential,
      planning=True,
      planning_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
  )

  # Run the crew
  my_crew.kickoff()
  ```

# Processes

Detailed guide on workflow management through processes in CrewAI, with updated implementation details.

## Understanding Processes

<Tip>
  Processes orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents, akin to project management in human teams.
  These processes ensure tasks are distributed and executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy.
</Tip>

## Process Implementations

*   **Sequential**: Executes tasks sequentially, ensuring tasks are completed in an orderly progression.
*   **Hierarchical**: Organizes tasks in a managerial hierarchy, where tasks are delegated and executed based on a structured chain of command. A manager language model (`manager_llm`) or a custom manager agent (`manager_agent`) must be specified in the crew to enable the hierarchical process, facilitating the creation and management of tasks by the manager.
*   **Consensual Process (Planned)**: Aiming for collaborative decision-making among agents on task execution, this process type introduces a democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. It is planned for future development and is not currently implemented in the codebase.

## The Role of Processes in Teamwork

Processes enable individual agents to operate as a cohesive unit, streamlining their efforts to achieve common objectives with efficiency and coherence.

## Assigning Processes to a Crew

To assign a process to a crew, specify the process type upon crew creation to set the execution strategy. For a hierarchical process, ensure to define `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` for the manager agent.

```python
from crewai import Crew
from crewai.process import Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Example: Creating a crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
    agents=my_agents,
    tasks=my_tasks,
    process=Process.sequential
)

# Example: Creating a crew with a hierarchical process
# Ensure to provide a manager_llm or manager_agent
crew = Crew(
    agents=my_agents,
    tasks=my_tasks,
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
    # or
    # manager_agent=my_manager_agent
)
```

**Note:** Ensure `my_agents` and `my_tasks` are defined prior to creating a `Crew` object, and for the hierarchical process, either `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` is also required.

## Sequential Process

This method mirrors dynamic team workflows, progressing through tasks in a thoughtful and systematic manner. Task execution follows the predefined order in the task list, with the output of one task serving as context for the next.

To customize task context, utilize the `context` parameter in the `Task` class to specify outputs that should be used as context for subsequent tasks.

## Hierarchical Process

Emulates a corporate hierarchy, CrewAI allows specifying a custom manager agent or automatically creates one, requiring the specification of a manager language model (`manager_llm`). This agent oversees task execution, including planning, delegation, and validation. Tasks are not pre-assigned; the manager allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses task completion.

## Process Class: Detailed Overview

The `Process` class is implemented as an enumeration (`Enum`), ensuring type safety and restricting process values to the defined types (`sequential`, `hierarchical`). The consensual process is planned for future inclusion, emphasizing our commitment to continuous development and innovation.

## Conclusion

The structured collaboration facilitated by processes within CrewAI is crucial for enabling systematic teamwork among agents.
This documentation has been updated to reflect the latest features, enhancements, and the planned integration of the Consensual Process, ensuring users have access to the most current and comprehensive information.


# Tasks

Detailed guide on managing and creating tasks within the CrewAI framework.

## Overview of a Task

In the CrewAI framework, a `Task` is a specific assignment completed by an `Agent`.

Tasks provide all necessary details for execution, such as a description, the agent responsible, required tools, and more, facilitating a wide range of action complexities.

Tasks within CrewAI can be collaborative, requiring multiple agents to work together. This is managed through the task properties and orchestrated by the Crew's process, enhancing teamwork and efficiency.

### Task Execution Flow

Tasks can be executed in two ways:

*   **Sequential**: Tasks are executed in the order they are defined
*   **Hierarchical**: Tasks are assigned to agents based on their roles and expertise

The execution flow is defined when creating the crew:

```python Code
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2],
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    process=Process.sequential  # or Process.hierarchical
)
```

## Task Attributes

| Attribute                        | Parameters        | Type                        | Description                                                            |

## Creating Tasks

There are two ways to create tasks in CrewAI: using **YAML configuration (recommended)** or defining them **directly in code**.

### YAML Configuration (Recommended)

Using YAML configuration provides a cleaner, more maintainable way to define tasks. We strongly recommend using this approach to define tasks in your CrewAI projects.

After creating your CrewAI project as outlined in the [Installation](/installation) section, navigate to the `src/latest_ai_development/config/tasks.yaml` file and modify the template to match your specific task requirements.

<Note>
  Variables in your YAML files (like `{topic}`) will be replaced with values from your inputs when running the crew:

  ```python Code
  crew.kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'AI Agents'})
  ```
</Note>

Here's an example of how to configure tasks using YAML:

````yaml tasks.yaml
research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct a thorough research about {topic}
    Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
    the current year is 2024.
  expected_output: >
    A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about {topic}
  agent: researcher

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
    Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
  expected_output: >
    A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
    Formatted as markdown without '```'
  agent: reporting_analyst
  output_file: report.md
````

To use this YAML configuration in your code, create a crew class that inherits from `CrewBase`:

```python crew.py
# src/latest_ai_development/crew.py

from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

@CrewBase
class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
  """LatestAiDevelopment crew"""

  @agent
  def researcher(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
      config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
      verbose=True,
      tools=[SerperDevTool()]
    )

  @agent
  def reporting_analyst(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
      config=self.agents_config['reporting_analyst'],
      verbose=True
    )

  @task
  def research_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
      config=self.tasks_config['research_task']
    )

  @task
  def reporting_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
      config=self.tasks_config['reporting_task']
    )

  @crew
  def crew(self) -> Crew:
    return Crew(
      agents=[
        self.researcher(),
        self.reporting_analyst()
      ],
      tasks=[
        self.research_task(),
        self.reporting_task()
      ],
      process=Process.sequential
    )
```

<Note>
  The names you use in your YAML files (`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`) should match the method names in your Python code.
</Note>

### Direct Code Definition (Alternative)

Alternatively, you can define tasks directly in your code without using YAML configuration:

````python task.py
from crewai import Task

research_task = Task(
    description="""
        Conduct a thorough research about AI Agents.
        Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
        the current year is 2024.
    """,
    expected_output="""
        A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about AI Agents
    """,
    agent=researcher
)

reporting_task = Task(
    description="""
        Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
        Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
    """,
    expected_output="""
        A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
        Formatted as markdown without '```'
    """,
    agent=reporting_analyst,
    output_file="report.md"
)
````

<Tip>
  Directly specify an `agent` for assignment or let the `hierarchical` CrewAI's process decide based on roles, availability, etc.
</Tip>

## Task Output

Understanding task outputs is crucial for building effective AI workflows. CrewAI provides a structured way to handle task results through the `TaskOutput` class, which supports multiple output formats and can be easily passed between tasks.

The output of a task in CrewAI framework is encapsulated within the `TaskOutput` class. This class provides a structured way to access results of a task, including various formats such as raw output, JSON, and Pydantic models.

By default, the `TaskOutput` will only include the `raw` output. A `TaskOutput` will only include the `pydantic` or `json_dict` output if the original `Task` object was configured with `output_pydantic` or `output_json`, respectively.

### Task Output Attributes

| Attribute         | Parameters      | Type                       | Description                                                                                        |
| :---------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description**   | `description`   | `str`                      | Description of the task.                                                                           |
| **Summary**       | `summary`       | `Optional[str]`            | Summary of the task, auto-generated from the first 10 words of the description.                    |
| **Raw**           | `raw`           | `str`                      | The raw output of the task. This is the default format for the output.                             |
| **Pydantic**      | `pydantic`      | `Optional[BaseModel]`      | A Pydantic model object representing the structured output of the task.                            |
| **JSON Dict**     | `json_dict`     | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | A dictionary representing the JSON output of the task.                                             |
| **Agent**         | `agent`         | `str`                      | The agent that executed the task.                                                                  |
| **Output Format** | `output_format` | `OutputFormat`             | The format of the task output, with options including RAW, JSON, and Pydantic. The default is RAW. |

### Task Methods and Properties

| Method/Property | Description                                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **json**        | Returns the JSON string representation of the task output if the output format is JSON.           |
| **to\_dict**    | Converts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.                                           |
| **str**         | Returns the string representation of the task output, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw. |

### Accessing Task Outputs

Once a task has been executed, its output can be accessed through the `output` attribute of the `Task` object. The `TaskOutput` class provides various ways to interact with and present this output.

#### Example

```python Code
# Example task
task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

# Execute the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Accessing the task output
task_output = task.output

print(f"Task Description: {task_output.description}")
print(f"Task Summary: {task_output.summary}")
print(f"Raw Output: {task_output.raw}")
if task_output.json_dict:
    print(f"JSON Output: {json.dumps(task_output.json_dict, indent=2)}")
if task_output.pydantic:
    print(f"Pydantic Output: {task_output.pydantic}")
```

## Task Dependencies and Context

Tasks can depend on the output of other tasks using the `context` attribute. For example:

```python Code
research_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest developments in AI",
    expected_output="A list of recent AI developments",
    agent=researcher
)

analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the research findings and identify key trends",
    expected_output="Analysis report of AI trends",
    agent=analyst,
    context=[research_task]  # This task will wait for research_task to complete
)
```

## Task Guardrails

Task guardrails provide a way to validate and transform task outputs before they
are passed to the next task. This feature helps ensure data quality and provides
efeedback to agents when their output doesn't meet specific criteria.

### Using Task Guardrails

To add a guardrail to a task, provide a validation function through the `guardrail` parameter:

```python Code
from typing import Tuple, Union, Dict, Any

def validate_blog_content(result: str) -> Tuple[bool, Union[Dict[str, Any], str]]:
    """Validate blog content meets requirements."""
    try:
        # Check word count
        word_count = len(result.split())
        if word_count > 200:
            return (False, {
                "error": "Blog content exceeds 200 words",
                "code": "WORD_COUNT_ERROR",
                "context": {"word_count": word_count}
            })

        # Additional validation logic here
        return (True, result.strip())
    except Exception as e:
        return (False, {
            "error": "Unexpected error during validation",
            "code": "SYSTEM_ERROR"
        })

blog_task = Task(
    description="Write a blog post about AI",
    expected_output="A blog post under 200 words",
    agent=blog_agent,
    guardrail=validate_blog_content  # Add the guardrail function
)
```

### Guardrail Function Requirements

1.  **Function Signature**:
    *   Must accept exactly one parameter (the task output)
    *   Should return a tuple of `(bool, Any)`
    *   Type hints are recommended but optional

2.  **Return Values**:
    *   Success: Return `(True, validated_result)`
    *   Failure: Return `(False, error_details)`

### Error Handling Best Practices

1.  **Structured Error Responses**:

```python Code
def validate_with_context(result: str) -> Tuple[bool, Union[Dict[str, Any], str]]:
    try:
        # Main validation logic
        validated_data = perform_validation(result)
        return (True, validated_data)
    except ValidationError as e:
        return (False, {
            "error": str(e),
            "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
            "context": {"input": result}
        })
    except Exception as e:
        return (False, {
            "error": "Unexpected error",
            "code": "SYSTEM_ERROR"
        })
```

2.  **Error Categories**:
    *   Use specific error codes
    *   Include relevant context
    *   Provide actionable feedback

3.  **Validation Chain**:

```python Code
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple, Union

def complex_validation(result: str) -> Tuple[bool, Union[str, Dict[str, Any]]]:
    """Chain multiple validation steps."""
    # Step 1: Basic validation
    if not result:
        return (False, {"error": "Empty result", "code": "EMPTY_INPUT"})

    # Step 2: Content validation
    try:
        validated = validate_content(result)
        if not validated:
            return (False, {"error": "Invalid content", "code": "CONTENT_ERROR"})

        # Step 3: Format validation
        formatted = format_output(validated)
        return (True, formatted)
    except Exception as e:
        return (False, {
            "error": str(e),
            "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
            "context": {"step": "content_validation"}
        })
```

### Handling Guardrail Results

When a guardrail returns `(False, error)`:

1.  The error is sent back to the agent
2.  The agent attempts to fix the issue
3.  The process repeats until:
    *   The guardrail returns `(True, result)`
    *   Maximum retries are reached

Example with retry handling:

```python Code
from typing import Optional, Tuple, Union

def validate_json_output(result: str) -> Tuple[bool, Union[Dict[str, Any], str]]:
    """Validate and parse JSON output."""
    try:
        # Try to parse as JSON
        data = json.loads(result)
        return (True, data)
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        return (False, {
            "error": "Invalid JSON format",
            "code": "JSON_ERROR",
            "context": {"line": e.lineno, "column": e.colno}
        })

task = Task(
    description="Generate a JSON report",
    expected_output="A valid JSON object",
    agent=analyst,
    guardrail=validate_json_output,
    max_retries=3  # Limit retry attempts
)
```

## Getting Structured Consistent Outputs from Tasks

<Note>
  It's also important to note that the output of the final task of a crew becomes the final output of the actual crew itself.
</Note>

### Using `output_pydantic`

The `output_pydantic` property allows you to define a Pydantic model that the task output should conform to. This ensures that the output is not only structured but also validated according to the Pydantic model.

Here’s an example demonstrating how to use output\_pydantic:

```python Code
import json

from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from pydantic import BaseModel


class Blog(BaseModel):
    title: str
    content: str


blog_agent = Agent(
    role="Blog Content Generator Agent",
    goal="Generate a blog title and content",
    backstory="""You are an expert content creator, skilled in crafting engaging and informative blog posts.""",
    verbose=False,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm="gpt-4o",
)

task1 = Task(
    description="""Create a blog title and content on a given topic. Make sure the content is under 200 words.""",
    expected_output="A compelling blog title and well-written content.",
    agent=blog_agent,
    output_pydantic=Blog,
)

# Instantiate your crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
    agents=[blog_agent],
    tasks=[task1],
    verbose=True,
    process=Process.sequential,
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Option 1: Accessing Properties Using Dictionary-Style Indexing
print("Accessing Properties - Option 1")
title = result["title"]
content = result["content"]
print("Title:", title)
print("Content:", content)

# Option 2: Accessing Properties Directly from the Pydantic Model
print("Accessing Properties - Option 2")
title = result.pydantic.title
content = result.pydantic.content
print("Title:", title)
print("Content:", content)

# Option 3: Accessing Properties Using the to_dict() Method
print("Accessing Properties - Option 3")
output_dict = result.to_dict()
title = output_dict["title"]
content = output_dict["content"]
print("Title:", title)
print("Content:", content)

# Option 4: Printing the Entire Blog Object
print("Accessing Properties - Option 5")
print("Blog:", result)

```

In this example:

*   A Pydantic model Blog is defined with title and content fields.
*   The task task1 uses the output\_pydantic property to specify that its output should conform to the Blog model.
*   After executing the crew, you can access the structured output in multiple ways as shown.

#### Explanation of Accessing the Output

1.  Dictionary-Style Indexing: You can directly access the fields using result\["field\_name"]. This works because the CrewOutput class implements the **getitem** method.
2.  Directly from Pydantic Model: Access the attributes directly from the result.pydantic object.
3.  Using to\_dict() Method: Convert the output to a dictionary and access the fields.
4.  Printing the Entire Object: Simply print the result object to see the structured output.

### Using `output_json`

The `output_json` property allows you to define the expected output in JSON format. This ensures that the task's output is a valid JSON structure that can be easily parsed and used in your application.

Here’s an example demonstrating how to use `output_json`:

```python Code
import json

from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from pydantic import BaseModel


# Define the Pydantic model for the blog
class Blog(BaseModel):
    title: str
    content: str


# Define the agent
blog_agent = Agent(
    role="Blog Content Generator Agent",
    goal="Generate a blog title and content",
    backstory="""You are an expert content creator, skilled in crafting engaging and informative blog posts.""",
    verbose=False,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm="gpt-4o",
)

# Define the task with output_json set to the Blog model
task1 = Task(
    description="""Create a blog title and content on a given topic. Make sure the content is under 200 words.""",
    expected_output="A JSON object with 'title' and 'content' fields.",
    agent=blog_agent,
    output_json=Blog,
)

# Instantiate the crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
    agents=[blog_agent],
    tasks=[task1],
    verbose=True,
    process=Process.sequential,
)

# Kickoff the crew to execute the task
result = crew.kickoff()

# Option 1: Accessing Properties Using Dictionary-Style Indexing
print("Accessing Properties - Option 1")
title = result["title"]
content = result["content"]
print("Title:", title)
print("Content:", content)

# Option 2: Printing the Entire Blog Object
print("Accessing Properties - Option 2")
print("Blog:", result)
```

In this example:

*   A Pydantic model Blog is defined with title and content fields, which is used to specify the structure of the JSON output.
*   The task task1 uses the output\_json property to indicate that it expects a JSON output conforming to the Blog model.
*   After executing the crew, you can access the structured JSON output in two ways as shown.

#### Explanation of Accessing the Output

1.  Accessing Properties Using Dictionary-Style Indexing: You can access the fields directly using result\["field\_name"]. This is possible because the CrewOutput class implements the **getitem** method, allowing you to treat the output like a dictionary. In this option, we're retrieving the title and content from the result.
2.  Printing the Entire Blog Object: By printing result, you get the string representation of the CrewOutput object. Since the **str** method is implemented to return the JSON output, this will display the entire output as a formatted string representing the Blog object.

***

By using output\_pydantic or output\_json, you ensure that your tasks produce outputs in a consistent and structured format, making it easier to process and utilize the data within your application or across multiple tasks.

## Integrating Tools with Tasks

Leverage tools from the [CrewAI Toolkit](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai-tools) and [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools) for enhanced task performance and agent interaction.

## Creating a Task with Tools

```python Code
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key" # serper.dev API key

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

research_agent = Agent(
  role='Researcher',
  goal='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
  backstory="""You're a researcher at a large company.
  You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
  to the business.""",
  verbose=True
)

# to perform a semantic search for a specified query from a text's content across the internet
search_tool = SerperDevTool()

task = Task(
  description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
  expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
  agent=research_agent,
  tools=[search_tool]
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

This demonstrates how tasks with specific tools can override an agent's default set for tailored task execution.

## Referring to Other Tasks

In CrewAI, the output of one task is automatically relayed into the next one, but you can specifically define what tasks' output, including multiple, should be used as context for another task.

This is useful when you have a task that depends on the output of another task that is not performed immediately after it. This is done through the `context` attribute of the task:

```python Code
# ...

research_ai_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest developments in AI",
    expected_output="A list of recent AI developments",
    async_execution=True,
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

research_ops_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest developments in AI Ops",
    expected_output="A list of recent AI Ops developments",
    async_execution=True,
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

write_blog_task = Task(
    description="Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news",
    expected_output="Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long",
    agent=writer_agent,
    context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task]
)

#...
```

## Asynchronous Execution

You can define a task to be executed asynchronously. This means that the crew will not wait for it to be completed to continue with the next task. This is useful for tasks that take a long time to be completed, or that are not crucial for the next tasks to be performed.

You can then use the `context` attribute to define in a future task that it should wait for the output of the asynchronous task to be completed.

```python Code
#...

list_ideas = Task(
    description="List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

list_important_history = Task(
    description="Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important events.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 important events.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

write_article = Task(
    description="Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas.",
    expected_output="A 4 paragraph article about AI.",
    agent=writer,
    context=[list_ideas, list_important_history] # Will wait for the output of the two tasks to be completed
)

#...
```

## Callback Mechanism

The callback function is executed after the task is completed, allowing for actions or notifications to be triggered based on the task's outcome.

```python Code
# ...

def callback_function(output: TaskOutput):
    # Do something after the task is completed
    # Example: Send an email to the manager
    print(f"""
        Task completed!
        Task: {output.description}
        Output: {output.raw}
    """)

research_task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool],
    callback=callback_function
)

#...
```

## Accessing a Specific Task Output

Once a crew finishes running, you can access the output of a specific task by using the `output` attribute of the task object:

```python Code
# ...
task1 = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

#...

crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task1, task2, task3],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Returns a TaskOutput object with the description and results of the task
print(f"""
    Task completed!
    Task: {task1.output.description}
    Output: {task1.output.raw}
""")
```

## Tool Override Mechanism

Specifying tools in a task allows for dynamic adaptation of agent capabilities, emphasizing CrewAI's flexibility.

## Error Handling and Validation Mechanisms

While creating and executing tasks, certain validation mechanisms are in place to ensure the robustness and reliability of task attributes. These include but are not limited to:

*   Ensuring only one output type is set per task to maintain clear output expectations.
*   Preventing the manual assignment of the `id` attribute to uphold the integrity of the unique identifier system.

These validations help in maintaining the consistency and reliability of task executions within the crewAI framework.

## Task Guardrails

Task guardrails provide a powerful way to validate, transform, or filter task outputs before they are passed to the next task. Guardrails are optional functions that execute before the next task starts, allowing you to ensure that task outputs meet specific requirements or formats.

### Basic Usage

```python Code
from typing import Tuple, Union
from crewai import Task

def validate_json_output(result: str) -> Tuple[bool, Union[dict, str]]:
    """Validate that the output is valid JSON."""
    try:
        json_data = json.loads(result)
        return (True, json_data)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        return (False, "Output must be valid JSON")

task = Task(
    description="Generate JSON data",
    expected_output="Valid JSON object",
    guardrail=validate_json_output
)
```

### How Guardrails Work

1.  **Optional Attribute**: Guardrails are an optional attribute at the task level, allowing you to add validation only where needed.
2.  **Execution Timing**: The guardrail function is executed before the next task starts, ensuring valid data flow between tasks.
3.  **Return Format**: Guardrails must return a tuple of `(success, data)`:
    *   If `success` is `True`, `data` is the validated/transformed result
    *   If `success` is `False`, `data` is the error message
4.  **Result Routing**:
    *   On success (`True`), the result is automatically passed to the next task
    *   On failure (`False`), the error is sent back to the agent to generate a new answer

### Common Use Cases

#### Data Format Validation

```python Code
def validate_email_format(result: str) -> Tuple[bool, Union[str, str]]:
    """Ensure the output contains a valid email address."""
    import re
    email_pattern = r'^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$'
    if re.match(email_pattern, result.strip()):
        return (True, result.strip())
    return (False, "Output must be a valid email address")
```

#### Content Filtering

```python Code
def filter_sensitive_info(result: str) -> Tuple[bool, Union[str, str]]:
    """Remove or validate sensitive information."""
    sensitive_patterns = ['SSN:', 'password:', 'secret:']
    for pattern in sensitive_patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in result.lower():
            return (False, f"Output contains sensitive information ({pattern})")
    return (True, result)
```

#### Data Transformation

```python Code
def normalize_phone_number(result: str) -> Tuple[bool, Union[str, str]]:
    """Ensure phone numbers are in a consistent format."""
    import re
    digits = re.sub(r'\D', '', result)
    if len(digits) == 10:
        formatted = f"({digits[:3]}) {digits[3:6]}-{digits[6:]}"
        return (True, formatted)
    return (False, "Output must be a 10-digit phone number")
```

### Advanced Features

#### Chaining Multiple Validations

```python Code
def chain_validations(*validators):
    """Chain multiple validators together."""
    def combined_validator(result):
        for validator in validators:
            success, data = validator(result)
            if not success:
                return (False, data)
            result = data
        return (True, result)
    return combined_validator

# Usage
task = Task(
    description="Get user contact info",
    expected_output="Email and phone",
    guardrail=chain_validations(
        validate_email_format,
        filter_sensitive_info
    )
)
```

#### Custom Retry Logic

```python Code
task = Task(
    description="Generate data",
    expected_output="Valid data",
    guardrail=validate_data,
    max_retries=5  # Override default retry limit
)
```

## Creating Directories when Saving Files

You can now specify if a task should create directories when saving its output to a file. This is particularly useful for organizing outputs and ensuring that file paths are correctly structured.

```python Code
# ...

save_output_task = Task(
    description='Save the summarized AI news to a file',
    expected_output='File saved successfully',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[file_save_tool],
    output_file='outputs/ai_news_summary.txt',
    create_directory=True
)

#...
```

## Conclusion

Tasks are the driving force behind the actions of agents in CrewAI.
By properly defining tasks and their outcomes, you set the stage for your AI agents to work effectively, either independently or as a collaborative unit.
Equipping tasks with appropriate tools, understanding the execution process, and following robust validation practices are crucial for maximizing CrewAI's potential,
ensuring agents are effectively prepared for their assignments and that tasks are executed as intended.


# Testing

Learn how to test your CrewAI Crew and evaluate their performance.

## Introduction

Testing is a crucial part of the development process, and it is essential to ensure that your crew is performing as expected. With crewAI, you can easily test your crew and evaluate its performance using the built-in testing capabilities.

### Using the Testing Feature

We added the CLI command `crewai test` to make it easy to test your crew. This command will run your crew for a specified number of iterations and provide detailed performance metrics. The parameters are `n_iterations` and `model`, which are optional and default to 2 and `gpt-4o-mini` respectively. For now, the only provider available is OpenAI.

```bash
crewai test
```

If you want to run more iterations or use a different model, you can specify the parameters like this:

```bash
crewai test --n_iterations 5 --model gpt-4o
```

or using the short forms:

```bash
crewai test -n 5 -m gpt-4o
```

When you run the `crewai test` command, the crew will be executed for the specified number of iterations, and the performance metrics will be displayed at the end of the run.

A table of scores at the end will show the performance of the crew in terms of the following metrics:

<center>**Tasks Scores (1-10 Higher is better)**</center>

| Tasks/Crew/Agents  | Run 1 | Run 2 | Avg. Total |            Agents            | Additional Info                |
| :----------------- | :---: | :---: | :--------: | :--------------------------: | :----------------------------- |
| Task 1             |  9.0  |  9.5  |   **9.2**  |     Professional Insights    |                                |
|                    |       |       |            |          Researcher          |                                |
| Task 2             |  9.0  |  10.0 |   **9.5**  | Company Profile Investigator |                                |
| Task 3             |  9.0  |  9.0  |   **9.0**  |      Automation Insights     |                                |
|                    |       |       |            |          Specialist          |                                |
| Task 4             |  9.0  |  9.0  |   **9.0**  |     Final Report Compiler    | Automation Insights Specialist |
| Crew               |  9.00 |  9.38 |   **9.2**  |                              |                                |
| Execution Time (s) |  126  |  145  |   **135**  |                              |                                |

The example above shows the test results for two runs of the crew with two tasks, with the average total score for each task and the crew as a whole.


# Tools

Understanding and leveraging tools within the CrewAI framework for agent collaboration and task execution.

## Introduction

CrewAI tools empower agents with capabilities ranging from web searching and data analysis to collaboration and delegating tasks among coworkers.
This documentation outlines how to create, integrate, and leverage these tools within the CrewAI framework, including a new focus on collaboration tools.

## What is a Tool?

A tool in CrewAI is a skill or function that agents can utilize to perform various actions.
This includes tools from the [CrewAI Toolkit](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai-tools) and [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools),
enabling everything from simple searches to complex interactions and effective teamwork among agents.

## Key Characteristics of Tools

*   **Utility**: Crafted for tasks such as web searching, data analysis, content generation, and agent collaboration.
*   **Integration**: Boosts agent capabilities by seamlessly integrating tools into their workflow.
*   **Customizability**: Provides the flexibility to develop custom tools or utilize existing ones, catering to the specific needs of agents.
*   **Error Handling**: Incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation.
*   **Caching Mechanism**: Features intelligent caching to optimize performance and reduce redundant operations.

## Using CrewAI Tools

To enhance your agents' capabilities with crewAI tools, begin by installing our extra tools package:

```bash
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

Here's an example demonstrating their use:

## Creating your own Tools

<Tip>
  Developers can craft `custom tools` tailored for their agent’s needs or
  utilize pre-built options.
</Tip>

There are two main ways for one to create a CrewAI tool:

### Subclassing `BaseTool`

```python Code
from crewai.tools import BaseTool


class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Name of my tool"
    description: str = "Clear description for what this tool is useful for, your agent will need this information to use it."

    def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
        # Implementation goes here
        return "Result from custom tool"
```

### Utilizing the `tool` Decorator

```python Code
from crewai.tools import tool
@tool("Name of my tool")
def my_tool(question: str) -> str:
    """Clear description for what this tool is useful for, your agent will need this information to use it."""
    # Function logic here
    return "Result from your custom tool"
```

### Structured Tools

The `StructuredTool` class wraps functions as tools, providing flexibility and validation while reducing boilerplate. It supports custom schemas and dynamic logic for seamless integration of complex functionalities.

#### Example:

Using `StructuredTool.from_function`, you can wrap a function that interacts with an external API or system, providing a structured interface. This enables robust validation and consistent execution, making it easier to integrate complex functionalities into your applications as demonstrated in the following example:

```python
from crewai.tools.structured_tool import CrewStructuredTool
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define the schema for the tool's input using Pydantic
class APICallInput(BaseModel):
    endpoint: str
    parameters: dict

# Wrapper function to execute the API call
def tool_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    # Here, you would typically call the API using the parameters
    # For demonstration, we'll return a placeholder string
    return f"Call the API at {kwargs['endpoint']} with parameters {kwargs['parameters']}"

# Create and return the structured tool
def create_structured_tool():
    return CrewStructuredTool.from_function(
        name='Wrapper API',
        description="A tool to wrap API calls with structured input.",
        args_schema=APICallInput,
        func=tool_wrapper,
    )

# Example usage
structured_tool = create_structured_tool()

# Execute the tool with structured input
result = structured_tool._run(**{
    "endpoint": "https://example.com/api",
    "parameters": {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
})
print(result)  # Output: Call the API at https://example.com/api with parameters {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
```

### Custom Caching Mechanism

<Tip>
  Tools can optionally implement a `cache_function` to fine-tune caching
  behavior. This function determines when to cache results based on specific
  conditions, offering granular control over caching logic.
</Tip>

```python Code
from crewai.tools import tool

@tool
def multiplication_tool(first_number: int, second_number: int) -> str:
    """Useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together."""
    return first_number * second_number

def cache_func(args, result):
    # In this case, we only cache the result if it's a multiple of 2
    cache = result % 2 == 0
    return cache

multiplication_tool.cache_function = cache_func

writer1 = Agent(
        role="Writer",
        goal="You write lessons of math for kids.",
        backstory="You're an expert in writing and you love to teach kids but you know nothing of math.",
        tools=[multiplication_tool],
        allow_delegation=False,
    )
    #...
```

## Conclusion

Tools are pivotal in extending the capabilities of CrewAI agents, enabling them to undertake a broad spectrum of tasks and collaborate effectively.
When building solutions with CrewAI, leverage both custom and existing tools to empower your agents and enhance the AI ecosystem. Consider utilizing error handling,
caching mechanisms, and the flexibility of tool arguments to optimize your agents' performance and capabilities.


# Training

Learn how to train your CrewAI agents by giving them feedback early on and get consistent results.

## Introduction

The training feature in CrewAI allows you to train your AI agents using the command-line interface (CLI).
By running the command `crewai train -n <n_iterations>`, you can specify the number of iterations for the training process.

During training, CrewAI utilizes techniques to optimize the performance of your agents along with human feedback.
This helps the agents improve their understanding, decision-making, and problem-solving abilities.

### Training Your Crew Using the CLI

To use the training feature, follow these steps:

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where your CrewAI project is located.
3.  Run the following command:

```shell
crewai train -n <n_iterations> <filename> (optional)
```

<Tip>
  Replace `<n_iterations>` with the desired number of training iterations and `<filename>` with the appropriate filename ending with `.pkl`.
</Tip>

### Training Your Crew Programmatically

To train your crew programmatically, use the following steps:

1.  Define the number of iterations for training.
2.  Specify the input parameters for the training process.
3.  Execute the training command within a try-except block to handle potential errors.

```python Code
n_iterations = 2
inputs = {"topic": "CrewAI Training"}
filename = "your_model.pkl"

try:
    YourCrewName_Crew().crew().train(
      n_iterations=n_iterations, 
      inputs=inputs, 
      filename=filename
    )

except Exception as e:
    raise Exception(f"An error occurred while training the crew: {e}")
```

### Key Points to Note

*   **Positive Integer Requirement:** Ensure that the number of iterations (`n_iterations`) is a positive integer. The code will raise a `ValueError` if this condition is not met.
*   **Filename Requirement:** Ensure that the filename ends with `.pkl`. The code will raise a `ValueError` if this condition is not met.
*   **Error Handling:** The code handles subprocess errors and unexpected exceptions, providing error messages to the user.

It is important to note that the training process may take some time, depending on the complexity of your agents and will also require your feedback on each iteration.

Once the training is complete, your agents will be equipped with enhanced capabilities and knowledge, ready to tackle complex tasks and provide more consistent and valuable insights.

Remember to regularly update and retrain your agents to ensure they stay up-to-date with the latest information and advancements in the field.

Happy training with CrewAI! 🚀

# Coding Agents

Learn how to enable your CrewAI Agents to write and execute code, and explore advanced features for enhanced functionality.

## Introduction

CrewAI Agents now have the powerful ability to write and execute code, significantly enhancing their problem-solving capabilities. This feature is particularly useful for tasks that require computational or programmatic solutions.

## Enabling Code Execution

To enable code execution for an agent, set the `allow_code_execution` parameter to `True` when creating the agent.

Here's an example:

```python Code
from crewai import Agent

coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Senior Python Developer",
    goal="Craft well-designed and thought-out code",
    backstory="You are a senior Python developer with extensive experience in software architecture and best practices.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)
```

<Note>
  Note that `allow_code_execution` parameter defaults to `False`.
</Note>

## Important Considerations

1.  **Model Selection**: It is strongly recommended to use more capable models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 when enabling code execution.
    These models have a better understanding of programming concepts and are more likely to generate correct and efficient code.

2.  **Error Handling**: The code execution feature includes error handling. If executed code raises an exception, the agent will receive the error message and can attempt to correct the code or
    provide alternative solutions. The `max_retry_limit` parameter, which defaults to 2, controls the maximum number of retries for a task.

3.  **Dependencies**: To use the code execution feature, you need to install the `crewai_tools` package. If not installed, the agent will log an info message:
    "Coding tools not available. Install crewai\_tools."

## Code Execution Process

When an agent with code execution enabled encounters a task requiring programming:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Task Analysis">
    The agent analyzes the task and determines that code execution is necessary.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Code Formulation">
    It formulates the Python code needed to solve the problem.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Code Execution">
    The code is sent to the internal code execution tool (`CodeInterpreterTool`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Result Interpretation">
    The agent interprets the result and incorporates it into its response or uses it for further problem-solving.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Usage

Here's a detailed example of creating an agent with code execution capabilities and using it in a task:

```python Code
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create a task that requires code execution
data_analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of participants.",
    agent=coding_agent
)

# Create a crew and add the task
analysis_crew = Crew(
    agents=[coding_agent],
    tasks=[data_analysis_task]
)

# Execute the crew
result = analysis_crew.kickoff()

print(result)
```

In this example, the `coding_agent` can write and execute Python code to perform data analysis tasks.


# Conditional Tasks

Learn how to use conditional tasks in a crewAI kickoff

## Introduction

Conditional Tasks in crewAI allow for dynamic workflow adaptation based on the outcomes of previous tasks.
This powerful feature enables crews to make decisions and execute tasks selectively, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of your AI-driven processes.

## Example Usage

```python Code
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from crewai import Agent, Crew
from crewai.tasks.conditional_task import ConditionalTask
from crewai.tasks.task_output import TaskOutput
from crewai.task import Task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

# Define a condition function for the conditional task
# If false, the task will be skipped, if true, then execute the task.
def is_data_missing(output: TaskOutput) -> bool:
    return len(output.pydantic.events) < 10  # this will skip this task

# Define the agents
data_fetcher_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Fetcher",
    goal="Fetch data online using Serper tool",
    backstory="Backstory 1",
    verbose=True,
    tools=[SerperDevTool()]
)

data_processor_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Processor",
    goal="Process fetched data",
    backstory="Backstory 2",
    verbose=True
)

summary_generator_agent = Agent(
    role="Summary Generator",
    goal="Generate summary from fetched data",
    backstory="Backstory 3",
    verbose=True
)

class EventOutput(BaseModel):
    events: List[str]

task1 = Task(
    description="Fetch data about events in San Francisco using Serper tool",
    expected_output="List of 10 things to do in SF this week",
    agent=data_fetcher_agent,
    output_pydantic=EventOutput,
)

conditional_task = ConditionalTask(
    description="""
        Check if data is missing. If we have less than 10 events,
        fetch more events using Serper tool so that
        we have a total of 10 events in SF this week..
        """,
    expected_output="List of 10 Things to do in SF this week",
    condition=is_data_missing,
    agent=data_processor_agent,
)

task3 = Task(
    description="Generate summary of events in San Francisco from fetched data",
    expected_output="A complete report on the customer and their customers and competitors, including their demographics, preferences, market positioning and audience engagement.",
    agent=summary_generator_agent,
)

# Create a crew with the tasks
crew = Crew(
    agents=[data_fetcher_agent, data_processor_agent, summary_generator_agent],
    tasks=[task1, conditional_task, task3],
    verbose=True,
    planning=True
)

# Run the crew
result = crew.kickoff()
print("results", result)
```


# Create Custom Tools

Comprehensive guide on crafting, using, and managing custom tools within the CrewAI framework, including new functionalities and error handling.

## Creating and Utilizing Tools in CrewAI

This guide provides detailed instructions on creating custom tools for the CrewAI framework and how to efficiently manage and utilize these tools,
incorporating the latest functionalities such as tool delegation, error handling, and dynamic tool calling. It also highlights the importance of collaboration tools,
enabling agents to perform a wide range of actions.

### Subclassing `BaseTool`

To create a personalized tool, inherit from `BaseTool` and define the necessary attributes, including the `args_schema` for input validation, and the `_run` method.

```python Code
from typing import Type
from crewai.tools import BaseTool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class MyToolInput(BaseModel):
    """Input schema for MyCustomTool."""
    argument: str = Field(..., description="Description of the argument.")

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Name of my tool"
    description: str = "What this tool does. It's vital for effective utilization."
    args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = MyToolInput

    def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
        # Your tool's logic here
        return "Tool's result"
```

### Using the `tool` Decorator

Alternatively, you can use the tool decorator `@tool`. This approach allows you to define the tool's attributes and functionality directly within a function,
offering a concise and efficient way to create specialized tools tailored to your needs.

```python Code
from crewai.tools import tool

@tool("Tool Name")
def my_simple_tool(question: str) -> str:
    """Tool description for clarity."""
    # Tool logic here
    return "Tool output"
```

### Defining a Cache Function for the Tool

To optimize tool performance with caching, define custom caching strategies using the `cache_function` attribute.

```python Code
@tool("Tool with Caching")
def cached_tool(argument: str) -> str:
    """Tool functionality description."""
    return "Cacheable result"

def my_cache_strategy(arguments: dict, result: str) -> bool:
    # Define custom caching logic
    return True if some_condition else False

cached_tool.cache_function = my_cache_strategy
```

By adhering to these guidelines and incorporating new functionalities and collaboration tools into your tool creation and management processes,
you can leverage the full capabilities of the CrewAI framework, enhancing both the development experience and the efficiency of your AI agents.

*   **Customizable Management**: Define managerial roles and responsibilities that align with your project's goals.

## Setting a Manager LLM

If you're using the hierarchical process and don't want to set a custom manager agent, you can specify the language model for the manager:

```python Code
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

manager_llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4")

crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[task],
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm=manager_llm
)
```

<Note>
  Either `manager_agent` or `manager_llm` must be set when using the hierarchical process.

## Advanced Customization Options

Beyond the basic attributes, CrewAI allows for deeper customization to enhance an agent's behavior and capabilities significantly.

### Language Model Customization

Agents can be customized with specific language models (`llm`) and function-calling language models (`function_calling_llm`), offering advanced control over their processing and decision-making abilities.
It's important to note that setting the `function_calling_llm` allows for overriding the default crew function-calling language model, providing a greater degree of customization.

## Performance and Debugging Settings

Adjusting an agent's performance and monitoring its operations are crucial for efficient task execution.

### Verbose Mode and RPM Limit

*   **Verbose Mode**: Enables detailed logging of an agent's actions, useful for debugging and optimization. Specifically, it provides insights into agent execution processes, aiding in the optimization of performance.
*   **RPM Limit**: Sets the maximum number of requests per minute (`max_rpm`). This attribute is optional and can be set to `None` for no limit, allowing for unlimited queries to external services if needed.

### Maximum Iterations for Task Execution

The `max_iter` attribute allows users to define the maximum number of iterations an agent can perform for a single task, preventing infinite loops or excessively long executions.
The default value is set to 25, providing a balance between thoroughness and efficiency. Once the agent approaches this number, it will try its best to give a good answer.

## Customizing Agents and Tools

Agents are customized by defining their attributes and tools during initialization. Tools are critical for an agent's functionality, enabling them to perform specialized tasks.
The `tools` attribute should be an array of tools the agent can utilize, and it's initialized as an empty list by default. Tools can be added or modified post-agent initialization to adapt to new requirements.

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

### Example: Assigning Tools to an Agent

```python Code
import os
from crewai import Agent
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

# Set API keys for tool initialization
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"

# Initialize a search tool
search_tool = SerperDevTool()

# Initialize the agent with advanced options
agent = Agent(
  role='Research Analyst',
  goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis',
  backstory='An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.',
  tools=[search_tool],
  memory=True, # Enable memory
  verbose=True,
  max_rpm=None, # No limit on requests per minute
  max_iter=25, # Default value for maximum iterations
)
```

## Delegation and Autonomy

Controlling an agent's ability to delegate tasks or ask questions is vital for tailoring its autonomy and collaborative dynamics within the CrewAI framework. By default,
the `allow_delegation` attribute is now set to `False`, disabling agents to seek assistance or delegate tasks as needed. This default behavior can be changed to promote collaborative problem-solving and
efficiency within the CrewAI ecosystem. If needed, delegation can be enabled to suit specific operational requirements.

### Example: Disabling Delegation for an Agent

```python Code
agent = Agent(
  role='Content Writer',
  goal='Write engaging content on market trends',
  backstory='A seasoned writer with expertise in market analysis.',
  allow_delegation=True # Enabling delegation
)
```

## Conclusion

Customizing agents in CrewAI by setting their roles, goals, backstories, and tools, alongside advanced options like language model customization, memory, performance settings, and delegation preferences,
equips a nuanced and capable AI team ready for complex challenges.


# Force Tool Output as Result

Learn how to force tool output as the result in an Agent's task in CrewAI.

## Introduction

In CrewAI, you can force the output of a tool as the result of an agent's task.
This feature is useful when you want to ensure that the tool output is captured and returned as the task result, avoiding any agent modification during the task execution.

## Forcing Tool Output as Result

To force the tool output as the result of an agent's task, you need to set the `result_as_answer` parameter to `True` when adding a tool to the agent.
This parameter ensures that the tool output is captured and returned as the task result, without any modifications by the agent.

Here's an example of how to force the tool output as the result of an agent's task:

```python Code
from crewai.agent import Agent
from my_tool import MyCustomTool

# Create a coding agent with the custom tool
coding_agent = Agent(
        role="Data Scientist",
        goal="Produce amazing reports on AI",
        backstory="You work with data and AI",
        tools=[MyCustomTool(result_as_answer=True)],
    )

# Assuming the tool's execution and result population occurs within the system
task_result = coding_agent.execute_task(task)
```

## Workflow in Action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Task Execution">
    The agent executes the task using the tool provided.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tool Output">
    The tool generates the output, which is captured as the task result.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent Interaction">
    The agent may reflect and take learnings from the tool but the output is not modified.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Result Return">
    The tool output is returned as the task result without any modifications.
  </Step>

# Hierarchical Process

A comprehensive guide to understanding and applying the hierarchical process within your CrewAI projects, updated to reflect the latest coding practices and functionalities.

## Introduction

The hierarchical process in CrewAI introduces a structured approach to task management, simulating traditional organizational hierarchies for efficient task delegation and execution.
This systematic workflow enhances project outcomes by ensuring tasks are handled with optimal efficiency and accuracy.

<Tip>
  The hierarchical process is designed to leverage advanced models like GPT-4, optimizing token usage while handling complex tasks with greater efficiency.
</Tip>

## Hierarchical Process Overview

By default, tasks in CrewAI are managed through a sequential process. However, adopting a hierarchical approach allows for a clear hierarchy in task management,
where a 'manager' agent coordinates the workflow, delegates tasks, and validates outcomes for streamlined and effective execution. This manager agent can now be either
automatically created by CrewAI or explicitly set by the user.

### Key Features

*   **Task Delegation**: A manager agent allocates tasks among crew members based on their roles and capabilities.
*   **Result Validation**: The manager evaluates outcomes to ensure they meet the required standards.
*   **Efficient Workflow**: Emulates corporate structures, providing an organized approach to task management.
*   **System Prompt Handling**: Optionally specify whether the system should use predefined prompts.
*   **Stop Words Control**: Optionally specify whether stop words should be used, supporting various models including the o1 models.
*   **Context Window Respect**: Prioritize important context by enabling respect of the context window, which is now the default behavior.
*   **Delegation Control**: Delegation is now disabled by default to give users explicit control.
*   **Max Requests Per Minute**: Configurable option to set the maximum number of requests per minute.
*   **Max Iterations**: Limit the maximum number of iterations for obtaining a final answer.

## Implementing the Hierarchical Process

To utilize the hierarchical process, it's essential to explicitly set the process attribute to `Process.hierarchical`, as the default behavior is `Process.sequential`.
Define a crew with a designated manager and establish a clear chain of command.

<Tip>
  Assign tools at the agent level to facilitate task delegation and execution by the designated agents under the manager's guidance.
  Tools can also be specified at the task level for precise control over tool availability during task execution.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Configuring the `manager_llm` parameter is crucial for the hierarchical process.
  The system requires a manager LLM to be set up for proper function, ensuring tailored decision-making.
</Tip>

```python Code
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from crewai import Crew, Process, Agent

# Agents are defined with attributes for backstory, cache, and verbose mode
researcher = Agent(
    role='Researcher',
    goal='Conduct in-depth analysis',
    backstory='Experienced data analyst with a knack for uncovering hidden trends.',
    cache=True,
    verbose=False,
    # tools=[]  # This can be optionally specified; defaults to an empty list
    use_system_prompt=True,  # Enable or disable system prompts for this agent
    max_rpm=30,  # Limit on the number of requests per minute
    max_iter=5  # Maximum number of iterations for a final answer
)
writer = Agent(
    role='Writer',
    goal='Create engaging content',
    backstory='Creative writer passionate about storytelling in technical domains.',
    cache=True,
    verbose=False,
    # tools=[]  # Optionally specify tools; defaults to an empty list
    use_system_prompt=True,  # Enable or disable system prompts for this agent
    max_rpm=30,  # Limit on the number of requests per minute
    max_iter=5  # Maximum number of iterations for a final answer
)

# Establishing the crew with a hierarchical process and additional configurations
project_crew = Crew(
    tasks=[...],  # Tasks to be delegated and executed under the manager's supervision
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4"),  # Mandatory if manager_agent is not set
    process=Process.hierarchical,  # Specifies the hierarchical management approach
    respect_context_window=True,  # Enable respect of the context window for tasks
    memory=True,  # Enable memory usage for enhanced task execution
    manager_agent=None,  # Optional: explicitly set a specific agent as manager instead of the manager_llm
    planning=True,  # Enable planning feature for pre-execution strategy
)
```

### Workflow in Action

1.  **Task Assignment**: The manager assigns tasks strategically, considering each agent's capabilities and available tools.
2.  **Execution and Review**: Agents complete their tasks with the option for asynchronous execution and callback functions for streamlined workflows.
3.  **Sequential Task Progression**: Despite being a hierarchical process, tasks follow a logical order for smooth progression, facilitated by the manager's oversight.

## Conclusion

Adopting the hierarchical process in CrewAI, with the correct configurations and understanding of the system's capabilities, facilitates an organized and efficient approach to project management.
Utilize the advanced features and customizations to tailor the workflow to your specific needs, ensuring optimal task execution and project success.


# Human Input on Execution

Integrating CrewAI with human input during execution in complex decision-making processes and leveraging the full capabilities of the agent's attributes and tools.

## Human input in agent execution

Human input is critical in several agent execution scenarios, allowing agents to request additional information or clarification when necessary.
This feature is especially useful in complex decision-making processes or when agents require more details to complete a task effectively.

## Using human input with CrewAI

To integrate human input into agent execution, set the `human_input` flag in the task definition. When enabled, the agent prompts the user for input before delivering its final answer.
This input can provide extra context, clarify ambiguities, or validate the agent's output.

### Example:

```shell
pip install crewai
```

```python Code
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"  # serper.dev API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"

# Kickoff Crew Asynchronously

Kickoff a Crew Asynchronously

## Introduction

CrewAI provides the ability to kickoff a crew asynchronously, allowing you to start the crew execution in a non-blocking manner.
This feature is particularly useful when you want to run multiple crews concurrently or when you need to perform other tasks while the crew is executing.

## Asynchronous Crew Execution

To kickoff a crew asynchronously, use the `kickoff_async()` method. This method initiates the crew execution in a separate thread, allowing the main thread to continue executing other tasks.

### Method Signature

```python Code
def kickoff_async(self, inputs: dict) -> CrewOutput:
```

### Parameters

*   `inputs` (dict): A dictionary containing the input data required for the tasks.

### Returns

*   `CrewOutput`: An object representing the result of the crew execution.

## Potential Use Cases

*   **Parallel Content Generation**: Kickoff multiple independent crews asynchronously, each responsible for generating content on different topics. For example, one crew might research and draft an article on AI trends, while another crew generates social media posts about a new product launch. Each crew operates independently, allowing content production to scale efficiently.

*   **Concurrent Market Research Tasks**: Launch multiple crews asynchronously to conduct market research in parallel. One crew might analyze industry trends, while another examines competitor strategies, and yet another evaluates consumer sentiment. Each crew independently completes its task, enabling faster and more comprehensive insights.

*   **Independent Travel Planning Modules**: Execute separate crews to independently plan different aspects of a trip. One crew might handle flight options, another handles accommodation, and a third plans activities. Each crew works asynchronously, allowing various components of the trip to be planned simultaneously and independently for faster results.

## Example: Single Asynchronous Crew Execution

Here's an example of how to kickoff a crew asynchronously using asyncio and awaiting the result:

```python Code
import asyncio
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create a task that requires code execution
data_analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

# Create a crew and add the task
analysis_crew = Crew(
    agents=[coding_agent],
    tasks=[data_analysis_task]
)

# Async function to kickoff the crew asynchronously
async def async_crew_execution():
    result = await analysis_crew.kickoff_async(inputs={"ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]})
    print("Crew Result:", result)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(async_crew_execution())
```

## Example: Multiple Asynchronous Crew Executions

In this example, we'll show how to kickoff multiple crews asynchronously and wait for all of them to complete using `asyncio.gather()`:

```python Code
import asyncio
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create tasks that require code execution
task_1 = Task(
    description="Analyze the first dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

task_2 = Task(
    description="Analyze the second dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

# Create two crews and add tasks
crew_1 = Crew(agents=[coding_agent], tasks=[task_1])
crew_2 = Crew(agents=[coding_agent], tasks=[task_2])

# Async function to kickoff multiple crews asynchronously and wait for all to finish
async def async_multiple_crews():
    result_1 = crew_1.kickoff_async(inputs={"ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]})
    result_2 = crew_2.kickoff_async(inputs={"ages": [20, 22, 24, 28, 30]})

    # Wait for both crews to finish
    results = await asyncio.gather(result_1, result_2)

    for i, result in enumerate(results, 1):
        print(f"Crew {i} Result:", result)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(async_multiple_crews())
```


# Kickoff Crew for Each

Kickoff Crew for Each Item in a List

## Introduction

CrewAI provides the ability to kickoff a crew for each item in a list, allowing you to execute the crew for each item in the list.
This feature is particularly useful when you need to perform the same set of tasks for multiple items.

## Kicking Off a Crew for Each Item

To kickoff a crew for each item in a list, use the `kickoff_for_each()` method.
This method executes the crew for each item in the list, allowing you to process multiple items efficiently.

Here's an example of how to kickoff a crew for each item in a list:

```python Code
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create a task that requires code execution
data_analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent,
    expected_output="The average age calculated from the dataset"
)

# Create a crew and add the task
analysis_crew = Crew(
    agents=[coding_agent],
    tasks=[data_analysis_task],
    verbose=True,
    memory=False,
    respect_context_window=True  # enable by default
)

datasets = [
  { "ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45] },
  { "ages": [20, 25, 30, 35, 40] },
  { "ages": [30, 35, 40, 45, 50] }
]

# Execute the crew
result = analysis_crew.kickoff_for_each(inputs=datasets)
```

## Connecting to OpenAI-Compatible LLMs

You can connect to OpenAI-compatible LLMs using either environment variables or by setting specific attributes on the LLM class:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using Environment Variables">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Code
      import os

      os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
      os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"] = "https://api.your-provider.com/v1"
      os.environ["OPENAI_MODEL_NAME"] = "your-model-name"
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Using LLM Class Attributes">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Code
      llm = LLM(
          model="custom-model-name",

# Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff

Replay tasks from the latest crew.kickoff(...)

## Introduction

CrewAI provides the ability to replay from a task specified from the latest crew kickoff. This feature is particularly useful when you've finished a kickoff and may want to retry certain tasks or don't need to refetch data over and your agents already have the context saved from the kickoff execution so you just need to replay the tasks you want to.

<Note>
  You must run `crew.kickoff()` before you can replay a task.
  Currently, only the latest kickoff is supported, so if you use `kickoff_for_each`, it will only allow you to replay from the most recent crew run.
</Note>

Here's an example of how to replay from a task:

### Replaying from Specific Task Using the CLI

To use the replay feature, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your terminal or command prompt." />

# Sequential Processes

A comprehensive guide to utilizing the sequential processes for task execution in CrewAI projects.

## Introduction

CrewAI offers a flexible framework for executing tasks in a structured manner, supporting both sequential and hierarchical processes.
This guide outlines how to effectively implement these processes to ensure efficient task execution and project completion.

## Sequential Process Overview

The sequential process ensures tasks are executed one after the other, following a linear progression.
This approach is ideal for projects requiring tasks to be completed in a specific order.

### Key Features

*   **Linear Task Flow**: Ensures orderly progression by handling tasks in a predetermined sequence.
*   **Simplicity**: Best suited for projects with clear, step-by-step tasks.
*   **Easy Monitoring**: Facilitates easy tracking of task completion and project progress.

## Implementing the Sequential Process

To use the sequential process, assemble your crew and define tasks in the order they need to be executed.

```python Code
from crewai import Crew, Process, Agent, Task, TaskOutput, CrewOutput

# Define your agents
researcher = Agent(
  role='Researcher',
  goal='Conduct foundational research',
  backstory='An experienced researcher with a passion for uncovering insights'
)
analyst = Agent(
  role='Data Analyst',
  goal='Analyze research findings',
  backstory='A meticulous analyst with a knack for uncovering patterns'
)
writer = Agent(
  role='Writer',
  goal='Draft the final report',
  backstory='A skilled writer with a talent for crafting compelling narratives'
)

# Define your tasks
research_task = Task(
  description='Gather relevant data...', 
  agent=researcher, 
  expected_output='Raw Data'
)
analysis_task = Task(
  description='Analyze the data...', 
  agent=analyst, 
  expected_output='Data Insights'
)
writing_task = Task(
  description='Compose the report...', 
  agent=writer, 
  expected_output='Final Report'
)

# Form the crew with a sequential process
report_crew = Crew(
  agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],
  tasks=[research_task, analysis_task, writing_task],
  process=Process.sequential
)

# Execute the crew
result = report_crew.kickoff()

# Accessing the type-safe output
task_output: TaskOutput = result.tasks[0].output
crew_output: CrewOutput = result.output
```

### Note:

Each task in a sequential process **must** have an agent assigned. Ensure that every `Task` includes an `agent` parameter.

### Workflow in Action

1.  **Initial Task**: In a sequential process, the first agent completes their task and signals completion.
2.  **Subsequent Tasks**: Agents pick up their tasks based on the process type, with outcomes of preceding tasks or directives guiding their execution.
3.  **Completion**: The process concludes once the final task is executed, leading to project completion.

## Advanced Features

### Task Delegation

In sequential processes, if an agent has `allow_delegation` set to `True`, they can delegate tasks to other agents in the crew.
This feature is automatically set up when there are multiple agents in the crew.

### Asynchronous Execution

Tasks can be executed asynchronously, allowing for parallel processing when appropriate.
To create an asynchronous task, set `async_execution=True` when defining the task.

### Memory and Caching

CrewAI supports both memory and caching features:

*   **Memory**: Enable by setting `memory=True` when creating the Crew. This allows agents to retain information across tasks.
*   **Caching**: By default, caching is enabled. Set `cache=False` to disable it.

### Callbacks

You can set callbacks at both the task and step level:

*   `task_callback`: Executed after each task completion.
*   `step_callback`: Executed after each step in an agent's execution.

### Usage Metrics

CrewAI tracks token usage across all tasks and agents. You can access these metrics after execution.

## Best Practices for Sequential Processes

1.  **Order Matters**: Arrange tasks in a logical sequence where each task builds upon the previous one.
2.  **Clear Task Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions for each task to guide the agents effectively.
3.  **Appropriate Agent Selection**: Match agents' skills and roles to the requirements of each task.
4.  **Use Context**: Leverage the context from previous tasks to inform subsequent ones.

This updated documentation ensures that details accurately reflect the latest changes in the codebase and clearly describes how to leverage new features and configurations.
The content is kept simple and direct to ensure easy understanding.

### Note on Consistency in Naming

The names you use in your YAML files (`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`) should match the method names in your Python code.
For example, you can reference the agent for specific tasks from `tasks.yaml` file.
This naming consistency allows CrewAI to automatically link your configurations with your code; otherwise, your task won't recognize the reference properly.

#### Example References

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `agents.yaml` (`email_summarizer`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer`) file.
</Tip>

```yaml agents.yaml
email_summarizer:
    role: >
      Email Summarizer
    goal: >
      Summarize emails into a concise and clear summary
    backstory: >
      You will create a 5 bullet point summary of the report
    llm: mixtal_llm
```

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `tasks.yaml` (`email_summarizer_task`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer_task`) file.
</Tip>

```yaml tasks.yaml
email_summarizer_task:
    description: >
      Summarize the email into a 5 bullet point summary
    expected_output: >
      A 5 bullet point summary of the email
    agent: email_summarizer
    context:
      - reporting_task
      - research_task
```

Use the annotations to properly reference the agent and task in the `crew.py` file.

### Annotations include:

*   `@agent`
*   `@task`
*   `@crew`
*   `@tool`
*   `@before_kickoff`
*   `@after_kickoff`
*   `@callback`
*   `@output_json`
*   `@output_pydantic`
*   `@cache_handler`

```python crew.py
# ...
@agent
def email_summarizer(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        config=self.agents_config["email_summarizer"],
    )

@task
def email_summarizer_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config["email_summarizer_task"],
    )
# ...
```

<Tip>
  In addition to the [sequential process](../how-to/sequential-process), you can use the [hierarchical process](../how-to/hierarchical-process),
  which automatically assigns a manager to the defined crew to properly coordinate the planning and execution of tasks through delegation and validation of results.
  You can learn more about the core concepts [here](/concepts).
</Tip>

### Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff

CrewAI now includes a replay feature that allows you to list the tasks from the last run and replay from a specific one. To use this feature, run.

```shell
crewai replay <task_id>
```

Replace `<task_id>` with the ID of the task you want to replay.

### Reset Crew Memory

If you need to reset the memory of your crew before running it again, you can do so by calling the reset memory feature:

```shell
crewai reset-memories --all
```

This will clear the crew's memory, allowing for a fresh start.

# Telemetry

Understanding the telemetry data collected by CrewAI and how it contributes to the enhancement of the library.

## Telemetry

<Note>
  By default, we collect no data that would be considered personal information under GDPR and other privacy regulations.
  We do collect Tool's names and Agent's roles, so be advised not to include any personal information in the tool's names or the Agent's roles.
  Because no personal information is collected, it's not necessary to worry about data residency.
  When `share_crew` is enabled, additional data is collected which may contain personal information if included by the user.
  Users should exercise caution when enabling this feature to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
</Note>

CrewAI utilizes anonymous telemetry to gather usage statistics with the primary goal of enhancing the library.
Our focus is on improving and developing the features, integrations, and tools most utilized by our users.

It's pivotal to understand that by default, **NO personal data is collected** concerning prompts, task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals,
usage of tools, API calls, responses, any data processed by the agents, or secrets and environment variables.
When the `share_crew` feature is enabled, detailed data including task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, and other specific attributes are collected
to provide deeper insights. This expanded data collection may include personal information if users have incorporated it into their crews or tasks.
Users should carefully consider the content of their crews and tasks before enabling `share_crew`.
Users can disable telemetry by setting the environment variable `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` to `true`.

# Code Docs RAG Search

The `CodeDocsSearchTool` is a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool designed for semantic searches within code documentation.

# `CodeDocsSearchTool`

<Note>
  **Experimental**: We are still working on improving tools, so there might be unexpected behavior or changes in the future.
</Note>

## Description

The CodeDocsSearchTool is a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool designed for semantic searches within code documentation.
It enables users to efficiently find specific information or topics within code documentation. By providing a `docs_url` during initialization,
the tool narrows down the search to that particular documentation site. Alternatively, without a specific `docs_url`,
it searches across a wide array of code documentation known or discovered throughout its execution, making it versatile for various documentation search needs.

## Installation

To start using the CodeDocsSearchTool, first, install the crewai\_tools package via pip:

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Example

Utilize the CodeDocsSearchTool as follows to conduct searches within code documentation:

```python Code
from crewai_tools import CodeDocsSearchTool

# To search any code documentation content 
# if the URL is known or discovered during its execution:
tool = CodeDocsSearchTool()

# OR

# To specifically focus your search on a given documentation site 
# by providing its URL:
tool = CodeDocsSearchTool(docs_url='https://docs.example.com/reference')
```

<Note>
  Substitute '[https://docs.example.com/reference](https://docs.example.com/reference)' with your target documentation URL
  and 'How to use search tool' with the search query relevant to your needs.
</Note>

## Arguments

The following parameters can be used to customize the `CodeDocsSearchTool`'s behavior:

| Argument      | Type     | Description                                                             |
| :------------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **docs\_url** | `string` | *Optional*. Specifies the URL of the code documentation to be searched. |

## Custom model and embeddings

By default, the tool uses OpenAI for both embeddings and summarization. To customize the model, you can use a config dictionary as follows:

```python Code
tool = CodeDocsSearchTool(
    config=dict(
        llm=dict(
            provider="ollama", # or google, openai, anthropic, llama2, ...
            config=dict(
                model="llama2",
                # temperature=0.5,
                # top_p=1,
                # stream=true,
            ),
        ),
        embedder=dict(
            provider="google", # or openai, ollama, ...
            config=dict(
                model="models/embedding-001",
                task_type="retrieval_document",
                # title="Embeddings",
            ),
        ),
    )
)
```


# Code Interpreter

The `CodeInterpreterTool` is a powerful tool designed for executing Python 3 code within a secure, isolated environment.

# `CodeInterpreterTool`

## Description

This tool enables the Agent to execute Python 3 code that it has generated autonomously. The code is run in a secure, isolated environment, ensuring safety regardless of the content.

This functionality is particularly valuable as it allows the Agent to create code, execute it within the same ecosystem,
obtain the results, and utilize that information to inform subsequent decisions and actions.

## Requirements

*   Docker

## Installation

Install the `crewai_tools` package

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Example

Remember that when using this tool, the code must be generated by the Agent itself.
The code must be a Python3 code. And it will take some time for the first time to run
because it needs to build the Docker image.

```python Code
from crewai import Agent
from crewai_tools import CodeInterpreterTool

Agent(
    ...
    tools=[CodeInterpreterTool()],
)
```

We also provide a simple way to use it directly from the Agent.

```python Code
from crewai import Agent

agent = Agent(
    ...
    allow_code_execution=True,
)
```


# Composio Tool

The `ComposioTool` is a wrapper around the composio set of tools and gives your agent access to a wide variety of tools from the Composio SDK.

# `ComposioTool`

## Description

This tools is a wrapper around the composio set of tools and gives your agent access to a wide variety of tools from the Composio SDK.

## Installation

To incorporate this tool into your project, follow the installation instructions below:

```shell
pip install composio-core
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

after the installation is complete, either run `composio login` or export your composio API key as `COMPOSIO_API_KEY`.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to initialize the tool and execute a github action:

1.  Initialize Composio tools

```python Code
from composio import App
from crewai_tools import ComposioTool
from crewai import Agent, Task


tools = [ComposioTool.from_action(action=Action.GITHUB_ACTIVITY_STAR_REPO_FOR_AUTHENTICATED_USER)]
```

If you don't know what action you want to use, use `from_app` and `tags` filter to get relevant actions

```python Code
tools = ComposioTool.from_app(App.GITHUB, tags=["important"])
```

or use `use_case` to search relevant actions

```python Code
tools = ComposioTool.from_app(App.GITHUB, use_case="Star a github repository")
```

2.  Define agent

```python Code
crewai_agent = Agent(
    role="Github Agent",
    goal="You take action on Github using Github APIs",
    backstory=(
        "You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Github "
        "on users behalf. You need to take action on Github using Github APIs"
    ),
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
)
```

3.  Execute task

```python Code
task = Task(
    description="Star a repo ComposioHQ/composio on GitHub",
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="if the star happened",
)

task.execute()
```

*   More detailed list of tools can be found [here](https://app.composio.dev)

This tool is used to perform a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) search within a CSV file's content. It allows users to semantically search for queries in the content of a specified CSV file.
This feature is particularly useful for extracting information from large CSV datasets where traditional search methods might be inefficient. All tools with "Search" in their name, including CSVSearchTool,
are RAG tools designed for searching different sources of data.

## Installation

Install the crewai\_tools package

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Example

```python Code
from crewai_tools import CSVSearchTool

# Initialize the tool with a specific CSV file. 
# This setup allows the agent to only search the given CSV file.
tool = CSVSearchTool(csv='path/to/your/csvfile.csv')

# OR

# Initialize the tool without a specific CSV file. 
# Agent will need to provide the CSV path at runtime.
tool = CSVSearchTool()
```

## Arguments

The following parameters can be used to customize the `CSVSearchTool`'s behavior:

| Argument | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                               |

# NL2SQL Tool

The `NL2SQLTool` is designed to convert natural language to SQL queries.

# `NL2SQLTool`

## Description

This tool is used to convert natural language to SQL queries. When passsed to the agent it will generate queries and then use them to interact with the database.

This enables multiple workflows like having an Agent to access the database fetch information based on the goal and then use the information to generate a response, report or any other output.
Along with that proivdes the ability for the Agent to update the database based on its goal.

**Attention**: Make sure that the Agent has access to a Read-Replica or that is okay for the Agent to run insert/update queries on the database.

## Requirements

*   SqlAlchemy
*   Any DB compatible library (e.g. psycopg2, mysql-connector-python)

## Installation

Install the crewai\_tools package

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Usage

In order to use the NL2SQLTool, you need to pass the database URI to the tool. The URI should be in the format `dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`.

```python Code
from crewai_tools import NL2SQLTool

# psycopg2 was installed to run this example with PostgreSQL
nl2sql = NL2SQLTool(db_uri="postgresql://example@localhost:5432/test_db")

@agent
def researcher(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        config=self.agents_config["researcher"],
        allow_delegation=False,
        tools=[nl2sql]
    )
```

## Example

The primary task goal was:

"Retrieve the average, maximum, and minimum monthly revenue for each city, but only include cities that have more than one user. Also, count the number of user in each city and
sort the results by the average monthly revenue in descending order"

So the Agent tried to get information from the DB, the first one is wrong so the Agent tries again and gets the correct information and passes to the next agent.

![alt text](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/blob/main/crewai_tools/tools/nl2sql/images/image-2.png?raw=true)
![alt text](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/raw/main/crewai_tools/tools/nl2sql/images/image-3.png)

The second task goal was:

"Review the data and create a detailed report, and then create the table on the database with the fields based on the data provided.
Include information on the average, maximum, and minimum monthly revenue for each city, but only include cities that have more than one user. Also, count the number of users in each city and sort the results by the average monthly revenue in descending order."

Now things start to get interesting, the Agent generates the SQL query to not only create the table but also insert the data into the table. And in the end the Agent still returns the final report which is exactly what was in the database.

![alt text](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/raw/main/crewai_tools/tools/nl2sql/images/image-7.png)

This is a simple example of how the NL2SQLTool can be used to interact with the database and generate reports based on the data in the database.

The Tool provides endless possibilities on the logic of the Agent and how it can interact with the database.
